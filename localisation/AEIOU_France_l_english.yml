    fra_extracontinental_agitation_desc:0 "Ever since the age of the Anglo-French conflicts in Canada to our great victories against the Indians the Kingdom of France has always been a seafaring nation. However, our nation has never dedicated much effort to assimilating said natives and perhaps to our detriment those peoples have refused to embrace our culture on their own, leading to their wish to secede from us once again.\n\nThis is the cause of much distress for Monsieur Lambert, the current leader of our Louisianan colony, the most dissident of all."
    
    fra_decaying_military:0 "Decaying Military"
    fra_decaying_military_desc:0 "It's been a long time since the last great conflict erupted in Europe and since, most nations have embraced a tactic of proxy wars and colonial uprisings which surprisingly worked when we supported the Latin-American colonies gain their independence from the Spanish Absolutists.\n\nUnluckily for us, this has meant that the army has become lazy and mutinous, and most of the heads of the General Armée are unambitious corrupt generals that grant posts in exchange for money and favours. This, mixed with the peasant's apathy towards a military career and its subsequent lack of fresh recruits has led to it becoming derisory and is continuously mocked by our souther neighbours, who entrench themselves in our border preparing one final push against our nation."

    fra_nationalist_breeding_ground_desc:0 "France is one, but the French people aren't. From Basques and Occitans in the south to Bretons, Alsatians and Brabantians in the North our nation is continuously divided linguistically, politically and economically, with some parts of the country paying less taxes than others and some peoples refusing to acknowledge that the people that rule from Palace of Versailles even exists.\n\nDue to our decentralization these people believe themselves to be something different than French, and this has led to several nationalist movements so perhaps it is now the moment to proclaim French as the only language and punish those who do not comply.\n\nLet them face the Bourbon wrath."
    
    fra_ramping_decentralization:0 "Rampant Decentralization"
    fra_ramping_decentralization_desc:0 "Unlike our southern neighbour, the Kingdom of France is known for its high level of decentralization. The noble families of Bretagne, Aquitaine and the many petty comtes, dukes and vicomtes that populate the Midi have stirred French politics for many generations. The Bourbon family has become a synonym of Moderate Absolutism over the time, as even if their intentions aren't the most moderate, the vassals are absolutely willing to remember each king of their duty as their suzerain, and this means respecting the Moderate Feudal contract. This can prove both beneficial and inefficient, as the Monarchy cannot gather as much soldiery as it would like just like the old Feudal contracts dictates, but this also means that we can be sure that we will have their support in any way or another, diplomatically or economically, as the same exact contract dictates that they are forced to comply no matter what.\n\nSome of them may become unruly should someone attempt to change the status quo."

This has led to a stagnant economic growth, and certain sectors have been allowed to simply decay as they weren't as profitable before as they are now.\n\nNow, even though the Ivory Market Crash has proven to be a catastrophe for our people, it is also led us to a land of new opportunities and new monopolies to be obtained, such as the one of silk or wood. Both sectors are already occupied, but we can surely make ourselves a little place either by diplomacy or by force."

Stockolm is known as the center of all and every trade that goes through the North Sea since the decay and collapse of the Hanseatic League but for the last few days it's remained strangely silent. Nothing came in, nothing came out. It has been rumoured that Queen Carola herself had visited the famous 'Elfenbensmarknaden' and didn't come out with good news.\n\nThe only thing we now know is that now Ivory is almost unsellable and that our economy, who had invested quite a few coins into the Ivory trade and all the goods that came with it, it is now left almost unsalvageable. We are lucky that we didn't invest as much as our northern neighbours but still. It has meant a hard hit to the Royal Treasury which we must now overcome without giving even the slightest look of weakness, or else our always power-hungry southern neighbour may strike us without warning.\n\nPerhaps it is time to give a good use to those lands obtained in India centuries ago that have been there just as a reminder of our military capabilities, but nothing more. Is it time, perhaps, to change that?"

    FRARealmevents.1.d:0 "It is just a normal day in the life of King Charles XI. He first gets up, attends some matters of state that range from servants and peasants complaining of grain shortages or cow stealings to high nobles complaining that their servants don't pay enough. This usually takes him around four to five hours but this week something is different.\n\nAfter packing off extremely quickly the last of the debtors King Charles meets with his High Command, which is mostly filled with unready generals that have never ever fought in a war but boast several medals in their chest. The only one that has seen some kind of combat is Monsieur Arsène Lambert, who is the current leader of the French lands of Louisiana currently visiting the mainland. He had been a junior commander during the invasion of Algeria more than forty years prior and since then his career has done nothing but rise. He now constantly clashes with the unruly natives that raid the woodcutters and miners that inhabit the inland regions of Louisiana and ravage the road system that transports resources from New Orleans to Ottawa. He informs King Charles that the natives have united under a new High Chief, whose name is yet unknown, and that said Chief has said no to mantaining friendly negotiations with the French military.\n\nThis has, of course, worried King Charles deeply and fears that he might instigate a rebellion in the near future, but nothing is yet planned nor is it going to be planned at least for the following months, such is the way of the French high command."

According to Governor Lambert, the 'Ghost Leader' that had been ravaging our comrades in the inlands has been identified as 'Nuage Rouge', leader of the Oglala Lakota, one of the most unruly tribes of the northwest. He has apparently managed to unite many tribes under his command and has proclaimed a 'Lakota Native State' whose intentions are not of independence but just to spite our local colonial rulers.\n\nSeveral of our units have been attacked and we fear that something even more massive is coming towards the south. We must also be ready to strike several of the native groups out of our colonial borders since several of our informants have told the Louisianan leadership that there have been some 'hidden talks' between heads of tribes.\n\nWe must also be wary of the Mexicans and New English, who have ambitions both on Texas and the Easternmost parts of the New Orleans region. But first; we've got a Cloud to destroy!"

Their aim is to get rid of all of the Frenchmen, and surely, their methods to do so will be as barbaric as their traditions.\n\nOne of such tribes are the Comanche, a loose confederation of several smaller tribes that decided to unite to form the human conglomerate of Comancheria, sitting between our southwestern border and the northern side of Mexico. They have conducted raids on our unguarded peoples in the past, but now they've embraced Nuage Rouge's call and have launched a full proned attack towards our more properly protected positions, ravaging everything in their path.\n\nThere is a way in which we could get rid of this scoundrel though. Following the same way in which the Lakota chieftain recalled his own loyalists to his aid, we could also take advantage of our diplomatic abilities, far more advanced than whatever those natives did, and get the Emperor of Mexico to join in the fray. We would have to grant him some land taken from the defeated Comanche but surely, we can't win alone; right?"

    FRALouisiana.3.d:0 "Emperor Francisco Fernando has always wanted to expand the borders of his country for the sake of glory and prosperity for his Habsburg Dynasty, with his branch always in the shadows of Austria and the Kingdom of the Romans. Even though he always keeps the military loyal and ready to strike whomever he seems fit; the opportunity has never arisen. That is, until now.\n\nEarly that morning an envoy had come from New Orleans, the struggling capital of the neighbouring colonial possession of France. With a nervous tone in his voice, he quickly notified the emperor and his ministers that Arsène Lambert, governor of the region, was in dire need of help, fearing for his life and of those of his loyal citizens. Nuage Rouge was nearing both the southern capital and the northern rich cities, and also that the natives were advancing in Canada, with the local governor unable to stop the flood of peoples wishing to reclaim their land.\n\nHe had come with a proposition; Mexico would enter the conflict in France's side and in return gain some land stolen from the Comanche, who often led raids on Mexican lands and killed loyal servants of the Emperor. Emperor Francisco Fernando had always heard about those raids, but as long as the main native chieftain didn't endorse them he wouldn't be able to break the native treaties his father had signed long ago. Now those treaties are broken and the army is as ready as ever, and that can only mean one thing. However, Emperor Francisco Fernando is a wise man, and doesn't really want to have to take on every single tribe on his border. What shall our answer be?"

Those Mexicans, whom we thought were our friends and their coward emperor, who was though to be supporter of the Western Colonial Cause, have refused to help us in our conflict against the native hordes, leaving us either to perish or to do all the work alone.\n\nWe don't know why the Austrian chose not to aid us in our conflict. Was perhaps the thought of having to actually fight too much for his coward self, or maybe there was some hidden darker interest behind his negative? Our scouts have recently noticed several Mexican Ritter Battalions patroling the border between the Comanche and ourselves, which could be literally that, just patrolling, but we can't really be sure, at least not now that Louisiana's survival is pending on a very tight rope.\n\nGovernor Lambert is certain that even if the Mexicans have refused to strike us they would surely at least respect our proud peoples, who have been constantly harassed by the uncivilized natives and now fight for their lives. Emperor Franz Ferdinand will not take advantage of our weakness... Right?"
    FRALouisiana.4.a:0 "Right?"
    
    FRALouisiana.5.t:0 "Partition of Comanchería"
    FRALouisiana.5.d:0 "We did it! After many hardships and tens of hundreds of dead countrymen at least one of Nuage Rouge's lapdogs has been defeated. The lands of the Comanche have been ravaged in a combined attack carried masterfully by both our troops and the brave Mexicans, who had to cross the mountains that separated their lands from the native savages in no time in order to achieve success in our ambitions.\n\nAs the victors that we are, and occupying most of the lands ourselves, we must now decide what to do with the domains of the defeated foe. The most reasonable and sensible decision would be to hand over the promised demarcation line to Emperor Franz Ferdinand, who sacrificed many of his men for another man's cause, but there's also the economic aspect of the treaty, which he hadn't really noticed until our troops were occupying most of the territory. It seems as if this place isn't as desolate as we thought, and precisely, in the lands that would have to go to the Mexicans we found several natural mines of precious metals and silver, incredibly expensive to purchase in Europe.\n\nIf we decide to annex all of the lands for ourselves the Mexican army won't be able to react quick enough, however, should our position against the other natives worsen, which isn't a very far fetched reality, the Mexicans could attack us with the wrath of a thousand cannons, scorching all lands that they stepped into, and our diminished and tire units could do nothing but look in despair.

Those traitorous french, after taking advantage of our benevolence and our wish to support the colonial cause, have refused to grant us what is rightfully ours. It seems as if they didn't control enough land already and  didn't import enough gold even though their market is full with it and their domains are as vast as all of our country. They had to break a treaty and show the entire world what a deceitful bunch they are for some gold found in almost unreachable mountains and valleys, fiercely protected by the natives.\n\nThe citizens of our capital gathered today in front of Emperor Francisco Fernando's Palace demanding answers, repayment and a public apology from the French, or else they would take up arms against the government for letting such an affront pass without any repercussions. Of course, the government itself was deeply angered by this selfish action, directed by King Charles 'the Vulture', as he is beginning to be known  in Mexico. Just like the animal, he lets others catch and kill their prey just to steal it himself.\n\nIt's widely understood that this action must not go unpunished, however the Government is divided whether we should go to war to reclaim our rightful piece of the Comanche cake or if we should demand money as payment; maybe even some of that Gold they've found, which would surely boost our coinage. Of course, why ask for some of it when you can just take it for yourself, having the right claim for it."

This should serve to their units as much of a morale boost as it did to ours. Both our armies' leadership met after the battle, and a treaty of friendship was signed to commemorate such an auspicious event. Everywhere in Mexico, from the arid deserts of the Northeast to the Jungle in the south, celebrations have erupted, praising Emperor Francisco Fernando and his valiant men, chanting songs in a mixture of Hispanicized German, and praising the Habsburg dynasty as the saviours of the trouble lands that once formed New Spain.\n\nSpeaking of them, the threat is not yet gone; however, now we can breathe with relief, for we've now made a friend whose interests also clash with the Spanish and who can protect us and attack at unison should the time to do so arose."

    FRAEconomy.1.d:0 "Regarding our ancient feudal system, it is no doubt that the Barons represent the biggest part of the nobility. No Count, Viscout or even Marquis can do as much as a Baron. Those high ranking titles are surely good for a lineage's prestige, but when the time of mingling with the commoners comes, it is the Barons who do all the funding and make sure all the laws are followed. Despite having expensive palaces or houses, the Barons tend to be far more down to Earth than the high nobility and often invest in the small group of peasants they rule.\n\nThey say that the French nobility is just 1% of the population, but if we had a Baron for each town there would be hundreds of thousands of them. It is for this reason that we must keep supporting the lower nobility, for it is their duty to ensure the well being of their subject, and they achieve so in a more personal matter than a Duke would ever be able to. With these grants we will be ensuring that no Baron that lost their fortune in the Ivory market will go on to live in poverty, and although in the beginning the populace might dislike the government for giving money to the nobility instead of the peasants, they'll surely understand how the economy works even if they're not educated."

In an attempt to quell the anger of the populace, we've been forced to act directly towards the lower classes instead of taking a more longer but efficient route. The Baron grants will continue, but another part of the slightly diminished treasure will be rerouted to funding better agricultural matters in the north, where our backwards economic system pales in comparison with the new technology the Spanish use. This is a matter of prestige, not of envy, and as such, we'll attempt to make our nation look far more advanced in the eyes of our European partners. Even if we cannot sustain the cost of heavily investing in Industry, like Spain has done, we can surely attempt to improve the lives of those who live away from the urban areas and who tend to be more prone to mutinees than their bourgeois counterpart. By granting several bulls to the best bidder, the ones with most cattle or more possibilities of progressing, we'll ensure that nobody is left behind in the bid for progress; well, except those who couldn't already sustain themselves before the crisis, but that group of peoples didn't support anything to the government and they'll continue to not do so in the future."

To further improve our situation, High Command believes it would be beneficial to purchase St. Andrews, also known as Fort Bayona; one of the few colonial posessions of the Duchy of Courland-Livonia.\n\nWould this mean a loss of prestige from their part? Well, certainly yes, but that isn't what the Courlanders need right now, being the Russians knocking on their door with a second Great Northern War about to happen.

As the people became more discontent towards the inaction of the king towards the clear enemy, the nobles took advantage of this to push the king to break the relative peace between the two. Following protests and several meetings, it spread around too quickly to be controlled.\nNow the entirety of the nation had been turned against the English, everyone holding the same beliefs as the higher estates, thinking that they could benefit from this although it will only lead to further instability, division, and an increase in taxes and military conscription.

Many generals suggested the king drop plans to enclose the Republic, but that would lead to instability, protests, and public discontent that could include the military.\nAfter a heated and protracted discussion, the king had finally come to a decision that he would soon announce to the heads of the military as well as to the angry and impatient nobility who were urging him to respond to the strong anti-English sentiment. In any case, France was not the only country that felt this way toward them.
