 spr_idea_strong_regional_fueros_desc:0 "The Fueros are, and have been since the 900s, the local rules and laws of the Vascongadas, the Kingdom of Navarre and the Kingdom of Aragon. The first two follow a more or less united system  but the Aragonese one is completely independent. \n\nThe population under the influence of the Fueros gets several benefits and exemptions that other regions of Spain don't get, like tax privileges and the option to not do the military service. This last one has damaged quite a bit the recruitment system of Spain as it inhabilites the conscription of serfs from a vast mass of land, which in turn damages the overall defensive and offensive capabilities of Spain. It is not that they can't join but that they have the option not to, and most of them choose the latter.\n\nThe fueros, on the other hand, keep the populace and the local nobles happy under Castilian majority and reduce any nationalistic sentimentd that could arise.\n\nOverall, getting rid of the Fueros is a bad idea and can lead to unwanted violence."

 spr_idea_religious_fanaticism:0 "Religious Fanaticism"
 spr_idea_religious_fanaticism_desc:0 " Since the creation of the Spanish Inquisition by the Catholic Monarchs in 1478, the kings of Spain and the clerisy have always dreamed of a pure Catholic kingdom where all of the heretics are either banished or killed instantly. However, in the last hundred years, a series of frail and undeciding monarchs led to the relaxation of the customs and the Inquisition lost many of its powers. The rise of Protestantism in the Spanish Netherlands caused great annoyance to the church, who told the kings they were inefficient in reaching their goal of religious purity.\n\nLuckily for the church after Felipe VI's rise to power, a devout zealot of Christ and the Pope, he made sure that nobody went astray and left the path of god. After the far-reaching purges that followed his coronation most of the positions appointed were those for the Church, making the most radical clerics his favourites. It was in this environment that the Inquisition got power again and begun purging and killing hundreds of alleged protestants and other religious figures, most of them without trial. For these deeds the Pope bestowed Felipe the title of "Catholic Monarch". This way of ruling has increased the devoutness of the peoples and the efficacy of the Church, but have also caused distress and anger in the most damaged sectors, like the high-nobility, the court and the serfs, whose weekly pay to the church has been increased considerably."

 spr_idea_backwards_economy_desc:0 "The Spanish economy has been suffering constant crashes for the past few hundred years. One day it allows the king to improve the palace or build another and the next day the state is completely drowned in debt. The nobility and the serfs aren't capable themselves to support it with their taxes and because of this the Spanish economic growth is ten times smaller than Austria's and twenty than France's. The previous rulers didn't care about supporting the economy with the money that flowed from the colonies nor did they improve what was already there and with it, the institutions slowly decayed, leading to an inefficient production and an extremely backwards farming system.\n\nMost of the Spanish monarchs, with very few exceptions, have only cared about expanding the realm, no matter the cost or the impact in the economy, and have forgotten the peninsula's needs for technological advancements in infrastructure and peasant matters like better production systems and quality of life improvements."

With economic growth curbed, this nation’s potential is significantly hampered.

However, there are still some conditions imposed that are not particularly well received. If this nation was able to find a way to leverage Spain, it is possible that they could liberate themselves from Spanish tyranny, first politically and now, finally, economically as well."

 SPRFlavour.1.t:0 "Marriage of Crown Prince Francisco"
 SPRFlavour.1.d:0 "Jolly news come from Madrid! It seems that Crown Prince Francisco of Habsburg has married Princess Louise of Habsburg-Lorraine, daughter of Ferdinand IV, ruling leader of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Currently nineteen years old, she is expected go eventually give birth to a heir once Francisco inherits the throne.\n\nAccording to human-interest newspaper 'El Cordial Saludo', Francisco and Louise met in one of King Felipe's many diplomatic missions to Tuscany, their biggest (and only) ally in the region. This mission probably happened three years prior, but has been kept secret until now. Crown Prince Francisco, known in the court as a charming handsome young man whose phisical appearance resembles more of his mother's lineage than from his father's; it is very easy to gaze why young Louise, just sixteen years old at the time, fell in love at first sight. Unexpectedly, Francisco seemed to accept her presence as he is known for rejecting every woman, noble or not, that attempted to arrange a marriage.\n\nIt is because of this that everyone in the court knows that the marriage will be a long lasting one."

 SPRFlavour.2.t:0 "A quiet night in Africa"
 SPRFlavour.2.d:0 "Larache, Spanish Command in The Rif - The scouts report no movement coming from the tribal jaimas, the houses of the Rifian natives. For the eigth night in a row, the once rebellious natives now sit in silence to the light of their manually lit fire, out in the cold desert mountains of Northern Morocco, looking menacingly towards the soldiers post with their guns nowhere to be seen. No move is reported and nothing seems out of place... It truly is unbelievable and because of this, the armies are now impatient and nearly paranoid, fearing an impending massive surprise attack. Their nerves suffer slowly from what is beginning to be called 'Cerebro de Arena', brain of sand, as it is the only thing in which many soldiers think.\n\n The Riffians seem to be oblivious of the state of the Spanish army, probably for the better, and have instead decided to engage in unbelievable peace talks and have resumed normal commerce with their colonists, just like if the war had never happened and their armies hadn't been killed by the thousands."

Having earned international praise with his past two books "Up in the mountain" and "The new Tartalo" now has published his third one, "Olentzero", just in time for Christmas as it narrates the tale of a Basque coalmaker who goes in a journey to meet Jesus at Bethlehem and eventually gains god's favour.\n\nOriginally published in the Roncalese dialect of the Basque language, Sagastibelcha has been continuately pushing for the unification of the dialects towards a more stable and less divided communication system. His efforts have been in vain for now but who knows what this bright man can achieve."

 SPRFlavour.4.d:0 "The marriage between Enrique de Bourbon, nephew of Felipe VI of Spain, and Blanche, eldest daughter of Charles XI of France, has taken place in Pau. Enrique, a noted liberal, is a good friend of Charles and a notable rival of Felipe. His marriage to the Bourbon king's daughter has further antagonized the King of Spain, who fears his nephew may use this to attempt to usurp his throne. It is unknown whether Charles XI will push Enrique’s claim to the throne and create an ally in Spain."

 SPRFlavour.5.t:0 "The Maragatos request proper protection"
 SPRFlavour.5.d:0 "The Maragatos, renowned merchants and excellent travelers, have been populating the region of the Maragatería for hundreds of years and continuously carry goods from the ports of Galicia to the capital city of Madrid. A few of them decided to visit the King’s palace after they had left the center of the city and now, carrying nothing with them, aired a petition to His Majesty.\n\nAccording to their reports, they are often subject to pillage by the many bandoleers that populate the roadways of the countryside, and although Felipe’s measures of cracking down on bandoleerism have enjoyed great success, many of the darkest, lesser known roadways, many of those still unpaved since Roman or Visigothic times, have become a safeguard for desperates, robbers and bandoleers alike.\n\nAs their duty to transport goods and food to all and every small village of the Maragateríam just as it is to resupply the capital, they have been subject to many attacks and now request gubernamental support to keep the trade flowing or else the supplies will stop arriving."

 SPRFlavour.6.t:0 "The crime was in Granada"
 SPRFlavour.6.d:0 "Tragic news come from the Andalusian city of Granada, the last bastion of muslims back in the fifteenth century. Several sources and witnesses have confirmed that a series of murders have been committed outside of the main city. According to the local authorities they are all related to family feuds and cite a cheating husband as the main reason.\n\nFollowing a male being caught by members of one of the many ruling families of the city he was beaten to death without any trial or time to explain himself. This man was apparently member of another prominent family, which has led to fighting between both, along with many minor branches of the two families. Several dead have been reported, along with tens of wounded, many simple bystanders. It isn't known when this situation will calm down but the authorities haven't been able to handle them."
 SPRFlavour.6.a:0 "Send in the military" 

 SPRFlavour.7.t:0 "The lost city of Arekoratos"
 SPRFlavour.7.d:0 "Deep in the heartland of mainland Spain lay many secrets, hidden for centuries. Sometimes, however, these secrets may come to light in the most varied ways. This time, due to the ongoing road expansion decreed by His Majesty Felipe VI, one of those ancient Iberian cities mentioned by Pliny the Elder has been found. Its name is Arekoratos and, if ancient sources don't lie, it was once a magnificent Iberian city, home to about one thousand ancient pagans.\n\nSadly, it was ravaged first by Romans and then by all the invaders of the fifth century that raided and settled Spain and all their habitants were forced to leave and to look for safer areas.\n\nNow, after close inspection by several experts, many items from the Spanish of the past have been unveiled and it is quite possible that hundreds of remains are still underground in unexplored areas. There are some that oppose the excavation though; namely the local authorities, who are the ones that have to pay for the roads as ordered by Felipe's decree. No funding is given by the royal treasury, so it is understandable that deviating a few kilometres might become expensive, and the locals aren't very keen on further paying."

 SPRFlavour.8.t:0 "Naturist Breakout"
 SPRFlavour.8.d:0 "Deep down in the small island of Santiago, known by the locals as Jamaica, a group of Spanish scientists entered not long ago into one of the many deep forests and jungles that populate the interior of the island. For the next five months they've dedicated themselves into researching the wildlife of the area, a topic not often mentioned in the books or in the European scientific community, who is still under the Christian yoke for the most part.\n\nIt seems that the group has discovered several species of bugs whom they've called Onychophora Spaniensis, in honour of our great country. The matter of discussion is, however, that these groups of Onychophora seem to have developed distinct small attributes to help them move depending if they live in the deeper jungle, where sunlight is scarce or the big mountain in the middle of the island. Some of the scientists have theorized something along the lines of 'evolution' to adapt to their newly discovered hypothesis.\n\nOf course, everything they propose goes against the Christian teachings, that speak about God's creation of each and every animal that populates the world. But, what if they were right? Could these scientists have made a step in the right direction?"

 SPRFlavour.9.t:0 "Something has crashed in Manila"
 SPRFlavour.9.d:0 "We've received not so long ago incredible news from Manila, the capital of our colony of the East Indies.\n\nApparently an asteroid coming from outer space has crashed into the Governor's palace and has made quite a hole in the ceiling and two walls. The asteroid has managed to successfully cross two floors until the reinforced stone remains of the 16th century building upon which the palace was built stopped the extraterrestrial object. The object, which looks more or less like an sphere and is of the size of a cannonball, is apparently red coloured, or at least that is what our report says. The report also mentions that a group of non specialized scientists that first analyzed the object in front of the pale looking East Indian Governor, they noted that the asteroid was of a material never seen, or at least noted to have seen, on earth.\n\nIt has been sent to Savoy, where the biggest community of geographs, geologists and astronomists of the entire world is located. It is possible that we don't ever know what the material is or if there is more of that on the earth but one thing is certain:\n\nMay God protect us all if one of those were to break through our ceiling!" 
 SPRFlavour.9.a:0 "Where is our geologist community?"
 
 SPRFlavour.10.t:0 "The fall of Whiteshirt"
 SPRFlavour.10.d:0 "Just as jousting a few centuries ago, dueling is now a very popular sport among the peasantry and the nobility and just as in jousting, the champions are widely acclamated. Of course, there are friendly duels, where nobody gets hurt other than people's pride and perhaps their shirt, and then there are rivalry based duels. But what if you mix both?\n\nYou get people like Roger 'Whiteshirt'. Roger was born in the city of Valencia and was educated in the ancient art of swordsmanship by his father and his family, who have been renowned swordsmen since their great ancestor Tirant became a soldier under the Almogavars and fought for the Byzantine Emperor. However, Roger soon became illusioned with gunnery and pistols and then took up dueling instead of joining the army. Having been banished and disinherited from his family, he wandered for years through the region of Valencia with only a white shirt, hence his nickname, although that shirt slowly begun becoming grey with red spots, signal of many of his injuries but also of his victories.\n\n King Felipe met Roger not so long ago when one of such events was organized in the capital for all to view for free. That event happened just a week ago and the populace hasn't been the same since. Apparently the greatly mysticiced Roger, who was known as a young man of great beauty, resulted to be nothing more than a grey haired, lifeless looking old man. He did put up a fight, however, and the crowd cheered his name whenever he killed off rounds of his opponents. When the final round arrived, however, Pedro de Zúñiga's champion beat Roger in a friendly combat, and, unable to accept that he had been defeated after ten years of non-stop victories, Roger assaulted the man, who promptly shot him dead."

 SPREarlyfelipe.1.t:0 "A day in Felipe's life"
 SPREarlyfelipe.1.d:0 "Felipe has never been a lazy monarch. Instead, he chooses to wake up at five o'clock in the morning and after a breakfast worthy of a king he goes on to attend the matters of state. Normally those matters are nothing more but minor nobles asking for favours or peasants begging for a job here or there. On days when the flow of beggars is significantly small he enjoys disguising himself as as a poor peasant and going to church with the masses but now he has no time to do any of those things as Felipe has begun demanding to meet more and more clerics and scholars from all over Spain and Europe, has also received several envoys from the Papal States and has even begun taking Latin classes, a language not even the high nobility can speak fluenty.\n\nIn the afternoons, when almost everyone except the most necessary and trusted of his servants are gone, Felipe goes under the castle, to one of the hidden rooms, and spends many hours there, reading or at least trying to read ancient documents."

 SPREarlyfelipe.2.t:0 "The Toledo Manifesto"
 SPREarlyfelipe.2.d:0 "In a recent speech in the city of Toledo, King Felipe VI proclaimed once again the need of expansion to avoid the stagnation of the kingdom.\n\n'...Spain needs to rule others, not because of hatred or religion but because of our suffering economy. It is in this times of need when the people must show their value and search for better lands while improving the ones we already have and make our ancestors proud. Fear not, however, as this expansion may not come as a bloody one, nor will it be by threats of force for the lands once ruled by the Spanish Empire shall become Spanish again by themselves. Having countries under our economic sphere is not enough, for we must take what is rightfuly ours and make our own use out of it. In the times of old, when the sun never set in The Empire...'\n\nThis speech has been nicknamed 'The Toledo Manifesto' because of its political significance. King Felipe was almost forced to give it to justify the Spanish interest and interference in the troubled countries of America, especially the crumbling nation of Centroamerica, whose ruinous state will be useful to the increased Spanish ambitions. This speech has been met with different reactions all across the Spanish-Speaking countries; Calixto Mendizabal, presiden of Centroamerica has quickly condemnated the speech and the Granadine president has called it "A threat to the establishment". The rest of the world remains silent upon these news."

 SPREarlyfelipe.3.t:0 "National Salvation Movement"
 SPREarlyfelipe.3.d:0 "Following weeks of constant reunions and deliberation, in a speech given outside of El Pardo, the Royal Spanish Castle, Felipe VI has proudly announced the creation of the "National Salvation Movement", a political-religious system designed for and by clerics.\n\nThe goal of this system is to grant more permissions to the religious figureheads of towns, cities and other urban domains and slowly displace the nobility into a weaker position of which the strengthened clerisy can take advantage. From purchasing their land to directly claim to take it in the name of god, the possibilities of this Movement/Law are almost endless. One thing is certain, though, the nobility isn't happy about it and doesn't seem like they will be in the near future.\n\nWith this new political move in communion with the high-clerisy, Felipe has made his distrust against the nobility very clear and visible for all and it is as plain as a pikestaff that he will not tolerate any dissidents."

 SPREarlyfelipe.4.d:0 "'Rejoice, ladies and gentlemen, for the King has signed a new set of laws that will improve all of your lives' claimed the royal newspaper 'El Real' in its principal page and with the letters in bold.\n\nIn reality, there are not many reasons to rejoice as the new Kingly laws, called 'Popular' to deceive the masses and make them believe that their leaders proposed them, they are no more than a new revision of the Serfdom that has been ruling Spain for the past centuries. In an attempt to appeal to the more moderate France or the liberals of Austria and to avoid being internationally isolated Felipe Vi ordered the draft of these laws, which include such vague concepts as "...For the people of Spain may have the right to leave their own settlements freely without having to fear the wrath of their past master but, should they want to do so, their leave must be either approved by the aforementioned master or have someone to substitute the serf's loss...'. It is very clear that not everyone is thrilled by this development."

 SPREarlyfelipe.5.d:0 "Terrible news come from the capital; apparently someone has attempted to assassinate King Felipe. We still don't know who the suspect was and there will be no way to know at least from his part for he has been killed by the rabble before the King's guard could catch him.\n\nIt was well past twelve o'clock when Felipe was walking down Quiñones street, a quiet, small street which once held the female prison, long gone. He was being followed by many peasants as he was not hiding his identity but there was no fear at the time as he was being protected by ten of his finest personal guardsmen. Then something caught his eye; on one of the balconies a man begun shouting to get the King's attention; he claimed to be Christ's envoy and claimed that something bad was going to happen to Felipe for his sins. Obviously, Felipe ordered the detention of the crazy shouting man and half of his guards left to assault the house. It was at this moment that one of the peasants that were surrounding Felipe took out a knife and attempted to strike it in the king's chest. Luckily, one of the guardsmen was quick enough to throw the King aside and halt the impact.\n\nAs the soldiers rushed to get Felipe up from the ground the peasants gathered around the frustrated murderer and beat him to death. The shouting man has not been caught yet."

 SPREarlyfelipe.6.t:0 "The Lex Christi"
 SPREarlyfelipe.6.d:0 "The Lex Christi, as the name suggests, is a law that enacts 'godlike' powers to the monarch, even further than common Absolutism.\n\nFollowing the events of Quiñones street, Felipe has decided to follow the path that eventually leads to paranoia. After making sure that everyone involved with the failed assassins were executed quickly reformed the 1886 laws, published just a few months prior, so that it also covered the king's domains. It seems that King Felipe took the commoner's threat about 'god's wrath' extremely seriously and now wants to secure his position. With the Lex Christi, in his semi-unfounded apprehension, King Felipe now controls everyone's lifes, from the palace to the entirety of the region of Madrid, and most of the nobility has been subject to harsh inspections and routinary callouts. This does not mean, however, that the commoners have been left unharmed; far from it as it was a mere peasant the one who attempted at Felipe's life. The Inquisition is more active than ever, knocking on the population's houses before dragging them out and publicly deriding them, most of the times without trial or proof.\n\nAll of these unfortunate events have truly aggravated the situation, with most of the population being against King Felipe and wishing to put his son Francisco in power insteadm whom they see as a 'rational' figurehead."

 SPREarlyfelipe.7.t:0 "The Lex Expiatoria"
 SPREarlyfelipe.7.d:0 "Following the disgraceful events that took place in Quiñones street, Felipe became a more taciturn monarch. 'Was the crazy man right? Have I gone too far?' Asked himself again and again. After discussing the matter of paying for his sins with several of his most loyal bishops he ordered them the writing of these laws presented today: The Lex Expiatoria. As its name indicates, these laws will allow the richest people of the realm to pay for his sins at a considerable price. This might seem similar to the 'Papal Bulls' the Pope allowed in the Middle Ages but far from it, for the Pope sees no money in this transaction and the Spanish Treasury keeps the vast majority; the rest going to the King's private treasure. Does this mean that Felipe has repented of his sins? No, of course, for the King has no need to pay himself the price of salvation; the enriched clerics just gave him a free pass, should he have the need to prove himself wrong once again.\n\nThe nobility, who became alienated by the 1886 set of laws, now rejoices at the King's expenses for their money now has a 'just' cause to pay. It looks like they are not so dissident after all."

 SPREarlyfelipe.8.t:0 "Proclamation of the Catholic Kingdom"
 SPREarlyfelipe.8.d:0 "¡Albricias y zapatetas! Today is a glorious day for the Kingdom of Spain as King Felipe VI has finally revealed his plans and all he has been working on the past months.\n\nAccording to his own speech, Felipe's intention of this new realm, which is merely a self imposed title with the permit of the Pope, is to oppose Kaiser Rudolf's viewpoint of the new Holy Roman Empire. This new Holy Roman Empire of his would me one more independent from the Papal States and more united than the previous one, with hated Rudolf at its top, something Felipe cannot allow. With this declaration the Pope officially turns his back against Rudolf and looks with kind eyes towards Felipe's zealous ambitions. Nothing changes for the Spanish populace's lives as they keep their previous laws, their previous masters and their previous precarious conditions. No matter what, today is truly a day to celebrate god's achievements on Earth and Felipe's achievements on God's soil.\n\nNow we can only wait and see how far Felipe's ambitions can go, and simply hope that they won't result in a war in the near future."

 SPREarlyfelipe.9.t:0 "Impact of the Collapse"
 SPREarlyfelipe.9.d:0 "It seems that King Felipe's words were extremely prophetic because not much time after his speech in Toledo Calixto Mendizabal, president of Centroamerica and the only person capable of keeping the state alive has been assassinated and now the entire realm is falling into chaos and dismembering itself into smaller and weaker states. It is, of course, Spain's obligation to reassert its dominance in the region and to deny the Mexicans any option of expansion, which they are surely trying to achieve in the Chiapas and Tapachula regions, the most pro-Mexican ones of the fallen Centroamerican state. Now it's the time for Felipe to take a break from national matters and zealous raves and to look outside; like a hunter that looks for its prey.\n\nCalling it 'A mission to restore the order in the region in behalf of Spanish interest' will surely justify Spanish imperialism in the zone and will keep the Austrians, French and Mexicans out of our way."
 SPREarlyfelipe.9.a:0 "Almost there!"
 
 SPREarlyfelipe.10.t:0 "What now?"
 SPREarlyfelipe.10.d:0 "It seems that King Felipe's attempts to please the gods didn't have the effect they intented as his only hope to expand in the Caribbean, the unstable country of Centroamerica, is now gone. With the failed assassination of Calixto Mendizabal he now rules in a way very similar to the one Felipe used to long ago when he succeeded his father. There have been several purges and the Guatemalan nobility now rules with an iron fist and crushes every attempt at getting independence. This means that Spain will not be able to assert its dominance in the region as much as Felipe would want.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that King Felipe will relinquish his dreams of power and if he cannot create his own Spice Route without sheding Spanish blood... He will have to take another's."

 SPREarlyfelipe.11.t:0 "Echoes of Victory!"
 SPREarlyfelipe.11.d:0 "Many parties have erupted in all neighbourhoods of the capital over the last few days and more are going to erupt in the next few weeks. The population, cheerful and full of joy for the King's victories in the Americas, celebrates them with beer and carousing and has forgotten all the monarchic mistreatments that have been happening in the past few weeks and the religious extremism seems like something from the years of the past while the Inquisition's misdeeds are simply something that only happen to the ones who don't behave adequately. There is no place for bad thoughts.\n\nThe new treaties King Felipe has signed mark the beginning of an economic miracle for the Spanish peoples, where the Burgeoisie and the Nobility will be able to enrich themselves without having to clash with each other and where the serfs and peasants will be able to buy their freedom from their masters by paying a small tithe. The trading of goods through the Atlantic thanks to the recently refounded 'Circulo Económico Caribeño' will see an impulse even bigger than the one the Castilian Kingdom received in the Golden Century of the Spanish Empire, in the beginnings of the 16th century.\n\nThese advancements have been mainly political until now, with some small exceptions here and there that aren't really necessary to mention, and clearly mark the beginning of a new set of global operations with the intention of stopping the decay of the Spanish Empire in all the forms possible, especially in the military, which has seen better days since the Spanish Third began being defeated towards the end of the 18th century. The subsequent years had been a constant downward spiral which culminated in the defeat of the War of 53 and the lost of all colonies in America with the exception of our Jewel of the Caribbean, Cuba, and some other minor islands in the region. Now, having at least fixed half of that, and still having a lot to do, King Felipe will have to face the increasing demand of military action against bigger powers, who might stand in our path."

 SPREarlyfelipe.12.t:0 "In the spotlight"
 SPREarlyfelipe.12.d:0 "'Something is rotten in Spanish politics' claimed King Felipe one afternoon sitting by himself in his private room and without any nosy servants in sight, not much after his attempted assassination. It was not the first time that King Felipe had proclaimed such negative words. He said something similar, for example, after the assassination of his father thirty years prior which eventually lead to the purge and political intrigues that defined his early years as a monarch. This time however, he is alone in his fight and completely unable to harm those who despise him, for they number in tens or hundreds and Felipe doesn't even know who is the enemy and who is a trustable courtier.\n\nThose traitors vary immensely in their birthplace and status, as both plebeians and serfs on one side and high ranking nobles and courtiers on the other want to see him ousted. King Felipe, in his zealous delirium, hadn't been able to foresee that all of that religiousness would be in vain, as the thing that was truly rotten in Spain was himself and all those clerics by whom he was surrounded, leading the once trusted companions into a downward spiral of hate and spite towards the Catholic institution; and although still Catholic themselves, many see Kaiser Rudolf of Habsburg, far away in his domains of the Holy Roman Empire, as an example to follow and all these pro-religious laws that marginalize the nobility and the peasantry don't help to change the situation or at least calm it down.\n\nNow it is time for King Felipe to attempt to save the situation and deal with all of the rebelling factions to reach a positive point or fail in the endeavour."

 SPREarlyfelipe.13.d:0 "Amidst all the chaos that has been happening recently in court, behind castle walls where no peasant can enter, a faction has been the most damnified by the new wave of anti-clericalism; the clerics themselves. This group of clerks, monks and even Papal envoys have seen themselves marginalized and banished from all court affairs except the ones organized by the king himself, in an attempt to quell the disturbance. Unluckily for him, once the rock has begun rolling there is no force big enough to stop it and a bunch of threats, which once worked with perfection to deter the complains of the high nobility, now pose but a symbolic message. A message of change, a message that maybe the nobility can stand against the king. This lack of 'Iron fists' has obviously scared the clerisy, which now hides behind the long arms of the Inquisition, whose radicalization grows day by day in an attempt to control the rebellious peasants that burn their state. Because not only the nobles have been damnified by the recent religious impositions, but also the small owners and the ones that rule towns and villages, who have been now substituted by 'Religious leaders' who do nothing to keep the peasants in hand, and in response, the latter have begun rioting against the harsh demands and the increased Diezmo, the compulsory pay of goods and food the serfs must do for the local church or abbey.\n\nFelipe's response has been a weak one, maybe weaker than expected, but what else can a mere man do, if his kingdom is an unruly one and if his peoples see him as a demented zealot?"

 SPREarlyfelipe.14.d:0 "There has been a huge stir in the capital recently. The well paved and well cared streets of Madrid, one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the entirety of Europe whose beauty is barely eclipsed by the frigid streets of Vienna and the sinful Paris, they have seen themselves now full of rubbish and the remains of several bombs and explosives. Should this not be enough sin, the location of those bombs is necessary to mention. One of them exploded right in front of the Cathedral of La Almudena when several high priests were having a meeting. At least three bystanders were killed by the bombs in an attack claimed via note by an anti-clerical terrorist group whose acronym is 'O.A.P.P'. Nothing is known about the perpetrators except the note left in the zone which was used to identify the group by it's name. No clerics were harmed.\n\nSadly, this has not been the last attack as near the city of Seville, renowned for its Catholicism, a group of harquebusiers has assaulted a clerical convoy and robbed them from their possessions. One of the servers was shot dead for resisting. It is not known if this was just an act of outlawry that took place in the wrong moment or if it is related to the aforementioned anti-clerical movement. King Felipe has made sure to publicly cite the event as such in a vague and lazy attempt to gain the sympathy of the moderate sector of the population, who despises the Inquisition and the violent rebels equally.\n\nKing Felipe has ordered the reinforcement of the main roads and churches to ensure safe passage of all religious men and women and has demanded the increase of harshness in religious related jail sentences, but he must not have thought about it thoroughly for is there anything harsher than death itself?"

It is not known what is going on inside but sounds of muskets being shot and loud cries can be heard from tens of metres around it. The Spanish Local military have surrounded the palace and are not letting anyone in; it seems to be a coup!\n\nIt all began in the morning, when King Felipe was awoken by nightmares that forshadowed what was about to come. Not soon after having breakfast in his private room, still scared, some courtiers requested his presence for some minor inconvenience that was taking place in one of the rooms of the vast palace. As oblivious as he was, for King Felipe had never been a man of brightness (He left that to his advisors), he gladly accepted their demand of help in an attempt to divert his mind from the terrible ephialtes he had suffered and, oblivious of any kind of rumours that had been being spread recently, entered the room without any question. Once the door was opened a shot came from the inside of the dark chamber. King Felipe hadn't been as lucky that time as the previous one in Quiñones street. Some of the courtiers that accompanied him, namely grand admiral of the fleet José de Entrevalles, didn't know about the act of treason that was happening right there and made an effort to stop the assaulting from ending his king's life. De Entrevalles quickly took out his flintlock pistol that he always carried charged and killed the shooter in one hit. He would later fight barefist the other two conspirator but in the end and after an unfair fight he would be stabbed and killed.\n\nKing Felipe used this valuable time to hide and finally exit the palace but his current location is actually unknown. He may be dead, he may be alive. One thing is certain though, should he be alive and safely hidden by his loyalist followers the wrath of the entirety of Spain will fall over the palace. In an effort to find him the revolting courtiers, with the blessing of the local nobility, have called in the military, the treacherous ones at least, so that they could surround the zone to avoid anyone and everyone from exiting the building."

The three representatives arrived early in the morning, each carrying papers and notes full of the faction they represent's wishes and demands. On one side, the Nobility and courtiers, on the other side the barons and landlords of the recently confiscated churchlands and on a last side and slightly marginalized: The peasantry. Nobody took these last ones' demands seriously.\n\nThe negotiations went better than expected and King Felipe showed a reasonable side of himself which wasn't seen often; however, once the more trivial matters were sorted with ease and the religious themes like the restoration of local property and the disbanding of the 'Inquisition Militias', as the court calls them, King Felipe returned to his typical wrath-driven obstructionism and denied any of the advances attempted by the parties, neither moderate nor radical. He conceded that some actions taken by the Inquisition had been without consideration and that innocent deaths had put a great stain on his 'impecable reign' but just offered a small monetary compensation to the victim's families instead of denouncing the actions taken by this violent and zealot group, being an ardient zealot himself.\n\nThe negotiations extended much of the day but in the end the three representatives left mostly empty handed and with the peasant one enraged by his inhability to press his claims without receiving severe mocking even from the other allied parties, not only the king. This has not helped to calm the situation at all and will only increase the tension instead."

Even if this situation of high decentralization is a bit unstable in the beginning, as all nobles must get accustomed to the new order, it will not be permanent, for the current nobility is just a placeholder, more specifically, a throne-holder and just awaits the election of a true monarch, either from the preceding dynasty or a new one.

He was no longer obsessed with god although he remained as his most ardent supporter, as always. Unlike the past three or four years of his rule, King Felipe actually begun to care about anything else than religion, something like... Actually ruling the country. Some claim he had been visited by Virgin Mary herself one night, but nobody knows what she told him that made him change his ways. The truth is, and it hurt him more than anyone to admit it, that in the past years he hadn't left a radius of ten kilometres around the capital. Many of his past advancements had gone mismanaged, ruled by the wrong hands, and most of the religious men he had appointed to preside over his projects were in no way capable to achieve what he had projected. It was all these evidences that proved King Felipe that, to actually achieve his dream of creating a truly Catholic Kingdom, he would need something more than a bunch of religious men. \n\nRenewed with energy and with his wound having developed into a very disgusting scar, but only that, he assembled all of the nobility and informed them of the situation, freeing them of most of their previous religious impositions in the process. \n\nThe king needed to regain his popularity not only in the Spanish realm, but also in the surrounding countries, who had been mocking him relentlessly during his extreme religious stage and he would achieve it no matter the cost, even by sacrificing his own men."

 SPRSecondfelipe.8.t:0 "An Invitation from Spain"
 SPRSecondfelipe.8.d:0 "We have just received a diplomatic envoy from Spain. They want to convince us to join their Absolutist Alliance.\n\nOn one hand, an ally in Spain will provide a large boost to our Italian ambitions. Having a powerful ally to counteract Austria will help us reach our dream of a unified Italian kingdom. Joining the alliance will also help safeguard our people from the liberal threat Austria poses.\n\nHowever, we know the Spanish have ambitions against France, a nation that we have worked so hard to please. Allying Spain would undo the hard work and would risk the possibility of France marching their army our way and crushing us."
 SPRSecondfelipe.8.a:0 "We gladly accept"
 SPRSecondfelipe.8.b:0 "We can't risk irritating the French"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.9.t:0 "Answer from Tuscany"
 SPRSecondfelipe.9.d:0 "Antonio María de la Cruz, the Spanish envoy in Tuscany, has received terrible news! Tuscany has refused our offer to join the Absolutist Alliance, as the king was not willing to risk harming their relations with France. Felipe is bitter that Tuscany chose France over us, and has spent all day stewing in anger. He knows that we have missed out on a prosperous trading partner and a strategic position to strike Austria.\n\nWe have also heard reports of increasing liberal agitation in Tuscan lands, and we have reason to believe the Austrians were behind their declining of our generosity."
 SPRSecondfelipe.9.a:0 "A Habsburg doesn't betray a Habsburg"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.10.t:0 "Answer from Tuscany"
 SPRSecondfelipe.10.d:0 "Antonio María de la Cruz, the Spanish envoy in Tuscany, has received excellent news! The Tuscans have accepted our generosity and have joined the Absolutist Alliance! The Tuscans have decided that they didn’t need the oppressive shackles of France and Austria set upon them and have broken free with us. King Felipe was overjoyed the rest of the day. We not only have gained another ally in our endeavors against France and Austria, we now have access to one of the most prosperous markets in Europe.\n\nThis is a momentous day for the Kingdom of Spain, as we have won a serious diplomatic victory that gives us many advantages."
 SPRSecondfelipe.10.a:0 "Long Live Spain! Long Live Tuscany!"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.11.t:0 "Securing the Homefront"
 SPRSecondfelipe.11.d:0 "Now that we are at war with the French, we must find a way to secure our homeland against threats from the inside. Francisco knows that all of the worthless generals and pro-French nobles have to be taken care of before we can make significant moves against our greatest enemy.\n\nHowever, Francisco and his nobles are unsure of how to dispose of them. More moderate nobles have called for the traitors to serve the rest of their lives in imprisonment. \n\nFrancisco and some more radical nobles, on the other hand, have called for the execution of the traitors and leaving it there. It would clearly show that Francisco has no tolerance of dissent.\n\nAfter hours of deliberation, it is time for Francisco to make his choice."
 SPRSecondfelipe.11.a:0 "Francisco is convinced by the moderates and throws them in prison."
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.12.t:0 "Envoy from Spain"
 SPRSecondfelipe.12.d:0 "The Pope has received a message from Juan Vazquez, the Spanish envoy. In that message, headed by a big procession of convoys coming from Spain whose members all treat the Pope like the god he is, request us to join the Absolutist Alliance.\n\nThe Pope, having many French, Austrian, and Spanish Cardinals, convened a meeting of all Cardinals to help him decide on the issue. As expected, the French and Austrian Cardinals vehemently opposed this idea, saying that if the Pope did so, he would be subjugating himself to the Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cardinals countered, saying that the Austrians wanted to corrupt the Papacy with liberal ideas, and the French want to, in fact, puppet the Papacy into supporting the misguided French, and discard the support of the devout Spaniards."
 SPRSecondfelipe.12.a:0 "King Felipe has always been good to us"
 SPRSecondfelipe.12.b:0 "The Pope's duty is to be neutral!"

 SPRSecondfelipe.13.t:0 "Receiving the Papacy’s Answer"
 SPRSecondfelipe.13.d:0 "Juan Vasquez, the Spanish envoy in the Holy See, has come back with terrible news! The Papacy has declined our offer to join the Absolutist Alliance. The Pope had convened a meeting of the Cardinals prior to making his decision, and they have convinced him to reject our alliance offer. King Felipe is was visibly trembling after hearing the news, as the world’s most powerful Catholic had essentially discarded him. He is gravely worried for the future of his regime.\n\nWe know that French and Austrian Cardinals must have been behind this. Why else would the Pope cast aside one of his most devout supporters?"
 SPRSecondfelipe.13.a:0 "We pray that God forgives the Pope for his shortsightedness."
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.14.t:0 "Answer from the Pope himself"
 SPRSecondfelipe.14.d:0 "Juan Vasquez, the Spanish envoy in the Holy See, has come back with excellent news! The Pope has decided to join the Absolutist Alliance! Before the decision was made, the Pope convened a meeting of Cardinals, and our Spanish Cardinals have convinced the Pope to join our alliance.\n\nKing Felipe had a look of great relief on his face, as the support of the world’s most powerful Catholic is sure to cement his regime.\n\nThe assistance of the Papacy in our alliance is an incredible boon, as the Pope commands millions of people around the globe, and can rally them to our cause. Now no one can stand in the way of our goals!"
 SPRSecondfelipe.14.a:0 "The generosity of the Pope will forever be enshrined in Spain."
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.15.t:0 "Receiving Portugal’s Answer"
 SPRSecondfelipe.15.d:0 "The Spanish envoy in Portugal, Enrique de Valera y Cortés, has been burdened with terrible news! The Portuguese have denied the Spanish offer of joining the Absolutist Alliance. We believe that the French are behind this, since French influence in Portugal has been steadily on the rise. The news troubled many of Spain’s generals, as they would now have to split Spanish forces between the French and Portuguese borders.\n\nThe generals now have serious doubts about our ability to defeat France in a war. The number of troops needed for two fronts is too much for the Spanish army."
 SPRSecondfelipe.15.a:0 "On the bright side, their colonies are now fair game..."
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.16.t:0 "Receiving Portugal’s Answer"
 SPRSecondfelipe.16.d:0 "The Spanish envoy in Portugal, Enrique de Valera y Cortés, has returned with excellent news! The Portuguese have accepted our offer to join the Absolutist Alliance. This news has greatly relieved top Spanish generals, as they need not to worry about fighting a two-front war. Their confidence has been greatly boosted, and it seemed to have infected the King, then the nobles, and then into the populace.\n\nIt is to our great benefit that the Portuguese threw off French influence and have joined us. However, France is enraged, and they will not forget Portugal’s betrayal anytime soon.
 SPRSecondfelipe.16.a:0 "Three Hurrahs for Portugal!"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.17.t:0 "An Offer from Spain"
 SPRSecondfelipe.17.d:0 "The Spanish envoy here in Portugal has given our king an offer: They want us to join the Absolutist Alliance.\n\nThis move would be highly unpopular among the commoners, as they seem to be enjoying the French cultural centers popping up in our territory. France has also proven to a highly beneficial ally and trading partner, reopening us to the Indian spice market and helping us add some new colonies under our belt.\n\nThe Nobles, however, worry about total French domination of our daily lives and want to distance ourselves from them. They believe that this new Spanish offer is the perfect opportunity for it. The Nobles think that Spain will be just as good of an ally that France has been, with the added benefit of helping our cultural brothers.
 SPRSecondfelipe.17.a:0 "Side with the commoners"
 SPRSecondfelipe.17.b:0 "Side with the nobles"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.18.t:0 "The General Pardon"
 SPRSecondfelipe.18.d:0 "Earler today, His Highness King Filipe issued a royal decree pardoning all those who have at any point in the history of Spain plotted to remove him from power. The decree pardoned anyone Spaniard who had plotted against the king regardless of race, gender, or class. Faced with great plans to strike the French state, king Felipe has made the risky decision on the hope of uniting the country.\n\nAddressing a crowd from all across the nation assembled outside the Zarzuela Palace, the king had this to say:\n\n'Spain must unite against those who would wish to see her people in shackles. Many of you have tried to overthrow my thrown, but I know you have done say because you love Spain. And if you truly love Spain then you will put your grievances aside and face our common enemy.'\n\nOnly time will tell whether the risky move will unite the country against the [insert country] invaders, or fracture it further by allowing rebellious factions the very freedom they need to win."
 SPRSecondfelipe.18.a:0 "For peace and prosperity!"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.19.t:0 "The Continuation of Absolutism"
 SPRSecondfelipe.19.d:0 "Shortly after Francisco I’s coronation, he gave a speech on the steps of the Royal Palace. The new King made it clear that no liberalization was going to take place, and that he would continue to pursue absolutist policies like his father before him.\n\nThis was met with an angry uproar from many in the crowd, who thought that with a new king would come new policies. Their rage was so great that Francisco had to be escorted inside and the royal guard had to set up fortifications on the steps. The King then ordered the guards to fire upon the crowd, which they obliged, killing eleven.\n\nThe crowd is not the only case of liberal anger. The military has many supporters for a liberal takeover, and Francisco worries that they will try to oust him and put his cousin Enrique on the throne. Both the Nobility and the Military have little faith in Francisco, saying that he is a weak man and monarch compared to his father, and are eager to see him off the throne. \n\nFrancisco knows that he also has a great amount of traditionalist support, so if worst comes to worst, he will have a great number of people rallied around him. 
 SPRSecondfelipe.19.a:0 "Absolutism prevails!"
 
 SPRSecondfelipe.20.t:0 "No more distractions!"
 SPRSecondfelipe.20.d:0 "Its nearly been four years since Felipe began his programs of change in the Kingdom of Spain.  He has fought off assassination attempts, the protests of his people and his nobles. He has sacrificed everything for his perfect vision of what Spain should be.  And now, finally, he has dealt with the insurgents, he has finished reforming the law, and he can move forward.\n\nHe has a singular goal now, one more enemy to defeat. No more waiting, no more scheming. No. More. Distractions."
 SPRSecondfelipe.20.a:0 "Who had to be crushed has been crushed"

 SPRCentroamerica.1.t:0 "Now what?"
 SPRCentroamerica.1.d:0 "It has been just a few days since the last of the newly created nations, El Salvador, declared its independence from the ruinous State of Centroamerica and now, with the situation under relative calm and the Guatemalans completely overwhelmed by the past events and absolutely unable to pose a real threat, our chance at greatness has finally appeared. Of course, taking direct actions against the new realms would be seen with very bad eyes in Vienna and Paris, whose leaders don't appreciate us too much to begin with, so we must contempt ourselves with reestablishing our rightful economic ties there.\n\nShould we face any resistance negotiating with any of the countries we will be sure to use more 'convincing' methods; rightful methods."

In this first wave of demans King Felipe has ordered special care and attention to detail and local traditions to avoid any and all possibilities of insulting them in any way and has also demanded that, should the envoys receive a no as answer no matter what they try, they must always act politely and not mention any threats at all as those will eventually come after they have left the country safely."

It might not have been the only reason but having such a burden is never positive and our already weak economy couldn't possible handle having such a big stone placed in its back, especially if that stone doesn't even bring anything positive to our lives. Should we refuse, however, we will be facing one of the world's biggest military against whom our newly created defence force cannot hope to win.\n\nThe Spanish envoys have talked with us of 'greatness', 'friendship' and 'economic prosperity' but if you look carefully, a devilish laughter reveals itself hidden behind those cheerful promises.

 SPRCuba.1.d:0 "Up to this moment, the Spanish Regency Council has only seen great successes. With the death of King Felipe and the banishment of the vast majority of the Habsburgs no noble or tenant has dared to oppose the new establishment... Until now.\n\nIt seems that the Pearl of the Caribbean, the Golden Island of Cuba, along with its population and leadership, is in reality full of treachery and enemity against the noble regency. The local governor, Joaquín Jovellar, has shown his unconditional support towards the deposed Habsburg dynasty and has started rallying soldiers cause. He is not, however, the only person in Cuba readying himself against our troops, and he knows this. Many natives have seen the brief period of chaos following King Felipe's assassination as an opportunity to rise against the Spanish slave trade and their Spanish masters and have taken up arms and begun a guerrilla campaign against the Regency's forces by hiding in the vast jungles of the center of the country. Both opposing parties seem to have an unmentioned truce so that they can focus on our undermanned positions. The fighting's intensity isn't very high as the natives are afraid to leave their cover in the forests and Commander Jovellar is afraid he won't have enough support for such an ambitious campaign. Only one thing is certain however; the situation won't have a peaceful ending."

 SPRCuba.2.t:0 "The Night of the Mutineers"
 SPRCuba.2.d:0 "Disaster! Joaquín Jovellar has decided to actually go ahead with his plan to revolt against the Regency's rule and has issued a public proclamation of the "Provisional government of Cuba" which is, of course, under his control and the natives have no representation. In an attempt to stop our troops from reinforcing the besieged loyalist units some of his nationalist supporters went ahead and burned all the ships in the port of La Havana, our capital city. With this defeat just in the beginning of what seems to be a long colonial war our loyal troops have seen themselves trapped in the Westernmost tip of the island. Luckily, the bulk of our troops has managed to hold control of the Santiago de Cuba - Guantánamo Bay, which contains a secondary port we can use to resupply our isolated units.\n\nAnd what have the natives been up to during all this bloodshed? They haven't dared to leave the jungle, of course. On the other hand... Our troops can't enter the jungle without being ambushed and killed by the hundreds.\n\nAll in all, we need to gather our units and get ready to recover our Jewel posession, which will grant a huge boost of popularity to the Regency and the high-nobles, who are beginning to get criticised by the peasants."

With our loyal troops having absolutely oblitterated their weak defenses and the native collaborationists having them all ambushed in the jungles, where they master the art of hiding, we have managed to achieve an almost total control of the island. Mainland Spain, unable to send any reinforcements because of their own infighting and chaos, has done nothing but watch as its best colony got lit on fire. That's what traitors get. The Spanish delegation isn't exactly surrendering though as they request the mantaining of a port under their direct control so that, even though they have lost the island, they can still trade and keep the Caribbean Circle running. It is up to us now to decide.\n\nNow that peace is at hand, should we accept their demands, of course, we need to focus on the 'Native problem' as there are rumours that the natives are organizing themselves into pockets of resistance and getting ready for a coup withing a coup, even threatening with another war in our precious island. Perhaps it is better to sign a quick peace with the Spanish so that we can focus in the emerging threat."

These combats, however, have not resulted in an improvement of the Spanish situation; which was already desperate back when the first peace meetings were held. Now, completely surrounding and nearing complete wipeout another peace offer has arrived in Havana, a more 'Favourable' one if we may say. The Spanish promise to leave the island completely, this time without ports of any kind, if we ensure the free passage of the armies currently trapped in the jungles and the ones sitiated in cities.

In this meeting the natives have been granted permission to have a position in local governments, although not in the official estate in La havana and they have also gotten the right to the land they posess. This also means that almost all of the slaves currently on the island have been granted freedom. Most of them don't have any money or private housing but that has been left to the native councils to be handled, we have more important matters to attend than freed slave housing.\n\nAll of these revolutionary achievements mean something, however, they confirm that there will be no more bloodshed in the Jewel of the Caribbean and now Spanish and Natives may live both in harmony and peace."

 #Sino-Spanish War
 
 SPRChinaffair.1.t:0 "Report from China"
 SPRChinaffair.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain and China are thousands of Royal Leagues (6,687 km) away, but this hasn't however, impossibilited the creation of trade between the two flourishing realms. In fact, it is because of this excess of trading that a 'Trade war' has emerged between the two.\n\nLuckily for everyone no shots are fired in this kind of wars, not officially at least, and the focus instead is set in sinking each other's economy until one of the participants surrenders and lets the other have a majoritarian economic presence in the region. Spain already took part in trade wars long ago, in the times when the British ruled the north of America and Spain had direct control of the south. That trade war became one of the factors of the collapse of the British realm so it is fairly understandable why over the last few months neither China nor ourselves have wanted to admit defeat, for we both fear becoming the next victim of economic harshness.\n\nThe Spanish trade in the Pacific region focuses mostly in the exploitation of wood and coal while the Chinese focus on selling silk and local spices but with the recent adhesion of Spain to the Silk Road and the rising difficulties to achieve a monopoly over spices because of the ongoing partition of India both nations have been 'forced' to begin this war. It is not known what will happen nor who will win, but one thing is certain, we are not going to surrender that easily."

The reason of the explosion is unknown but it seems that the first detonations begun in the magazine, where the ammo and gunpowder is stored, a place where all the crew knew not to lit anything on fire so it is suspicious that it exploded in the first place. The explosion killed half a dozen of our most expert marines, who were already sleeping in the ship. One of them, right before dying because of the severity of the burns he had received, mentioned that he had seen some shadows moving in the night and had heard some 'non-Spanish' sounds. We can't be sure however, for those sounds may have come from the port and not from inside the San Fernando."

They refused the accusations but a thorough investigation of their domiciles and their belongings has showed a big amount of gunpowder had been purchased by one of the five men. This gunpowder has been impossible to find, which proves that it has either vanished in the air or that it has been used and, of course, we now know for sure that it has been used and especifically where. The San Fernando was lit on fire by this group of five. While three of the men waited in the port, making sure nobody was there to report such treacherous and despicable actions, the other two jumped into the boat and set the charges while our good marines sleeped. It was at this moment, we assume, that the dead marine saw one of them but didn't report it. The five men now rot in one of our Hong Kongese darkest cells but perhaps, instead of just executing them, we could go a bit further and raise our voice against such a dishonourable act. It seems that two of the men had ties with mainland China so we could, maybe, demand China pay reparations even though we have no exact proof of its involvement in this affair."

Thousands of Chinese and non-Chinese alike gathered around this uncommon event. The five traitors had marks all around their bodies because of 'accidents' and had difficulties to walk but nonetheless, they were forced to walk until they were placed in front of the masses. They were offered to say some last words but none accepted such a gracious gift. Less than ten minutes after that all five were dead, hanging as a symbol of Spanish dominance and also as a symbol of what would happen to anyone that dares defy our power.

One thing is certain though, now that we have finally had an opportunity to establish diplomatic relations in such a grievous way, perhaps it is the moment to establish real diplomats and end this stupid commerical war, which is not doing any good neither to us nor to them. We should send another envoy thanking for their generous payment and also subtly offer them an economic treaty for the trade of silk and spices.\n\nWe could set up a monopoly that benefits both nations by dividing what each one of us will be focusing on and by sharing the earnings.

It seems that Admiral Juan Ignacio de Peñablanca, captain of the Spanish ship of 'La Buenaventura', observed an unknown ship in the distance that was coming directly against 'La Buenaventura'. The aforementioned ship was flying the Spanish pavilion but its actions proved contrary to what a Spaniard would do. Now we know that the commanding voice of the other ship was Captain Julián de la Cierva, but he was that moment comatose in bed because of an accident that had happened the day prior. It seems that his ship got too near to some rocks and it broke part of the stern. Captain de la Cierva hit his head in the floor because of the ship's harsh impact and became unconscious. Now, being the ship completely deprived of leadership, it was heading back to San Salvador de Formosa, the major port in the north of the island, to have the damage repaired.\n\nTen minutes before Admiral Juan Ignacio de Peñablanca saw the ship coming towards them, part of Captain de la Cierva's ship's rudder fell off, leaving the direction of the ship totally in the wind's hands. The wind decided, as we all now know, that the direction to take was to go completely towards the 'Buenaventura'. After all the attempts to civically contact the Spanish ship had failed, 'La Buenaventura´s' sailors fired a cannon towars the opposing ship but these ones mistook it as being attacked, as from their position the Spanish flag couldn't be seen, and responded to the fire with fire, but this one directed to the front of 'La Buenaventura'. Now without doubts of the Ship's owner, possibly the Chinese, Admiral de Peñablanca ordered a total strike on the opponent, and the others retaliated, killing many in the process. Admiral de Peñablanca managed to sink the other ship just in time to avoid a crash and when he went to save the few survivors of the opposing ship, he learned the truth, that he had sunk a Spanish ship and that he had killed Spanish men."

In retaliation for the losses suffered, the captain of this aforementioned ship decided to bomb a civilian port, something the Chinese, to put it lightly, have not taken it very well.\n\Truly a disgraceful event... or is it?

Pedro announced the plans of the Regency Government to enact a program of reform in the style of Emperor Rudolf III of Austria.The announcement has garnered nearly instantaneous reactions from Spain’s major political players.  Many of the more negative reactions stem from the Catholic Hierarchy who see Rudolf’s anti-clerical tendencies as a threat to their power at the very best, and heresy at worst. Surprisingly there has been a larger than expected positive reaction from the younger members of the nobility and lower ranking clergy who have become enamored with the young Hapsburg Emperor and his liberal ideals.  There has also been a universal expression of anxiety over the consequences of potential of closer ties with Austria, something that has prompted Pedro to issue assurances that Rudolf’s reform program will not be replicated wholesale but adapted into a piece of “…uniquely Spanish legislation.” Only time can tell whether this course of action will truly lead to lasting reform."

 SPRNetherlands.1.d:0 "Using some of our funding we have managed to buy several 'Tesla Engines', named after its creator Nikola Tesla, which promise to revolutionize the way production is handled and its majesty, in his immense inteligence, proposed sending them to the land of the Brabantians in an attempt to get some profit from that wasteland.\n\nIt is well known that the Flanders and Brabant region is not one of the most easy to cultivate and the people aren't helping much either so perhaps, giving them something else to worry about than revolting we can fix both nationalism and the crippling poverty that looms over all of them. Of course, this will require the help of the locals, or else all of our efforts will be in vain.\n\nLuckily for us, Spain always has an As up its sleeves, and that As is the lack of unity among the populace itself, with the peasants despising the nobility and viceversa, along with the elitist rich burgeois, which are hated by everyone. In the end only one will win: Us."

They quickly got to work with it and the best local minds came up with an idea to mechanize the grain production. It is still too early and the invention is absolutely rudimentary but some claim that the grain production of the month has been boosted a 25%.\n\nWe can't be sure if this is true or not but it is definitely good news.\n\nThe use of these new machines have surely gotten the attention of the richest people of the zone, who have now expressed their intention of buying some themselves to further profit of this new godly invention. We should expect some of their envoys to arrive in our court soon to discuss the purchase. One thing is clear though, we won't let them go cheaply."

In fact, all of the production achieved using this new method goes to the serfs themselves and the nobles aren't entitled to a single grain of wheat that they hadn't made.\n\nYou may be asking yourself why all of these 'progressive' meassures are being implemented in such an absolutist regime as King Felipe's, well, the answer is pretty simple. First of all, this way a division is created between the nobility and the serfdom, and also a price war is created that enforces merchantilistic mentalities. Second, all production is good production and of course, the state is going to sell the peasants our own version of the engine so all profits go to the treasury in Madrid, along with all the newly created taxes that the peasants haven't thought about.\n\nThe nobles may not be amused right now, but it is all for the state's sake, and the state is over everything else."

In fact, all of the production achieved using this new method goes to the nobles' pockets and not to the main estate. There are taxes, of course, but they are extremely reduced (for now).\n\nMany serfs have wondered what the Spanish government was thinking when this ultra-absolutist measures were implemented because now, they will not see an inch of the prosperity granted by the Tesla Engines.\n\nIn the highest spheres, however, there is only positive feelings regarding these advancements as the inversion made by the government a few months ago when they decided to buy the engines has been completely repaid and now the Brabantian serfs' attention has been distracted from their nationalistic fervor and instead has turned in an interest of abolishing their nobility while maintaining good relations with the central government of the metropolis."

Not even us. We expected that a few peasants would be able to pay off their independence but instead they have focused on making engines for everyone's farms, and althought they are of lesser quality, they have achieved partial economic independence, and many nobles have lost quite a few territories as most of the peasants have been able to pay off their estate for the first time in centuries. Apart from that; the Diezmo has been decimated and so, now it is the nobility who has begun suffering of hunger as most of their 'personally owned lands' are not being productive enough.\n\nAlthough this situation is very amusing for the peoples of the metropolis, who look at whatever is happening up north with interest, it may turn to violent means very very soon so, we need to keep an eye open in this belligerent region."

Now all peasants have the right to produce their own and sell it to the price they wish. They don't expect to enrich too much this way, but at least the ones that kept a monopoly over the prices now are forced to compete with the rest, like the rest. \n\nNobody in Felipe's court expected such 'progressist' result to come out of this violent region, but maybe not everything is fixed with violence. One thing is certain though: We have managed to befriend the local population, exceptuating the nobility and rich oligarchs, but what's better, a bunch of rich men or the entirety of the people who pay their taxes?\n\nWe are hearing, however, rumours of a conspiration between those rich men to revolt against our rule, but that isn't possible, right?"

He must either continue his policies with support from the moderate party and attempt to legitimize his position through political and religious reform, or he must abandon reform altogether to gain support from the hardline clergy and in doing so cement his control of the country.  No matter which choice he makes he will earn himself enemies, and he will likely be hard pressed to contain the situation peacefully.  Alternatively, Francisco could attempt to find a way to mend this ideological schism.  While compromise could prevent the devastation wrought by civil war, it would certainly be the most difficult task to accomplish and if handled carelessly could create an even larger conflict."

 SPRFrancisco.3.t:0 "The Unification of Navarre"
 SPRFrancisco.3.d:0 "Just days after his grand coronation ceremony, King Francisco has given a speech that has sparked off massive upheaval in a newly troubled Spain. Francisco has proclaimed that in light of the insulting reparations which the French have forced upon him under threat of war, he feels compelled to continue the absolutist policies of his Father.  Francisco argued that only through the power of an absolute monarch can this French insult to the Kingdom and to his family’s name be answered. Reports say that at the end Francisco’s speech, given to an audience of loyal nobles and then spread to the public at large, there was widespread applause.  This is not a reaction that has been echoed throughout the rest of Spain.\n\nMany of Francisco’s most ardent supporters until this point had been reform minded clergy, nobility, and workers.  Francisco’s address has dashed all hopes that Spain may see reform from the top down and has made what was already an unstable situation much more volatile.  Meanwhile, Francisco’s apparent loyalty to the status quo has earned him more friends among the often-reactionary nobility and clergy.  However, the speech has also sparked protests and even mutinies in the Spanish army.  Every passing day brings a lower likelihood of Francisco being able to avoid a civil conflict."

 SPRFrancisco.5.t:0 "Insurrection in the Palace"
 SPRFrancisco.5.d:0 "In response to his disastrous handling of the situation in India a powerful faction within the Spanish nobility confronted King Felipe. They gave him a choice, either abdicate the throne to his son Francisco I, or face an open rebellion. Seeing no other path forward, the once stubborn and iron fisted Catholic Monarch relented to the demands of the nobility. Felipe, having been assured his safety upon abdication, announced his plans to retire to a private residence and live out his remaining days peacefully.\n\nMeanwhile the palace court and market squares alike have been abuzz with gossip about the abdication of Felipe and the ascension of Francisco to the throne.  The council of nobles who have taken stewardship of the realm during the brief interregnum begin to busy themselves with the logistics of planning and executing a grand crowning ceremony.  As Felipe gathers what supplies and artifacts from the royal treasury he has been allowed to take, his son Francisco prepares himself to be the new King of Spain. The entire Catholic World is now wondering, what kind of monarch will Francisco be?

 SPREastindies.1.t:0 "A Ballad in Manila"
 SPREastindies.1.d:0 "The famous ‘nationalist’ writers of Jose Rizal and Andrés Bonifacio joined forces to write a new shocker of a novel, published in England away from the censors of the Spanish Colonial authorities. It tells a story about a philosopher who returns to his home country of the East Indies by an invitation from an old friend of his, he expected a warm welcome from his fellow countrymen, however all he saw was the sheer brutality from the Spanish authorities, describing in full length of how ‘bad’ the Spaniards treated the natives of the East Indies. Eventually he finally finds his old friend, and gets caught up in a nationalist revolt and eventually gets killed in the process, the book ends with his funeral and a post mortem of the plot.\n\nThe reactions to the new novel were mixed, some praising the sheer bravery of bringing the truth about the treatment of Spanish colonies from the ‘oppressors’, and how well written the story is, from its start to its end, the book feels like you were really in the story. Not all however, like the book especially the Spanish government, they criticized the book for over exaggerating the situation in the East Indies as the events described in the book happens very rarely in some situations, if things go really ugly, and they also criticize the novel for being very paranoid about their colonial government in the West Indies, as they said that “The colonial government is good enough for our standards”. The Spanish Government has since banned it on the Mainland and all of its colonies, however in the black market of the East Indies, it was a hidden bestseller among the underground Filipino independence movement."
