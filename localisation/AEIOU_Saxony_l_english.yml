  sax_idea_lions_of_dresden_desc:0 "Saxony rests in between the two largest states in the empire, Brandenburg, and Austria. Both lust after the territory of the duchy though the Saxons have no intention of yielding their freedom easily. The people of Saxony have long existed outside the authority of the Empire, allowing its rulers to more or less rule independently. The Germans that live there have a much different view of imperial authority than those living elsewhere.\n\nThe Elector of Saxony is a martial man by nature, and the attitude has been reflected in his people. Yet it is not just the army that is feeling the effects. The people of the capital have organized themselves into training battalions. It has become a tradition of when not working to go out and practice shooting and drills. The so-called Lions of Dresden simply embody the fighting spirit of Saxony and smaller formations around the state have formed. When the time comes the people of Saxony will be ready."

  sax_idea_wittin_line:0 "Wittin Line"
  sax_idea_wittin_line_desc:0 "Despite the proud tradition of independence, the Electorate of Saxony is not the most powerful state and its rulers often worry about maintaining their autonomy within the Empire. To help protect against their neighbors the current king's predecessor John of Saxony began the Wettin Line. A series of trenches, castles, forts, and strong-points within the countryside were put into place to defend against invasion. The hope isn't to actually stop the invasion but disrupt the flow of it, tying up troops on the fortifications.\n\nThe current king recognizes the importance of maintaining and expanding the Wettin Line, hoping that it serves as a deterrent for any invasion. Using his background as an army engineer, the king of Saxony has funneled experts and funds into its construction. This has taken a toll on the Saxon economy as the funds were taken from the meager tax base of the electorate. The rulers of Saxony hope that the money spent is worth it."

  sax_idea_diplomatic_middleman_desc:0 "Trapped between the two largest states of the Empire, Saxony has become a diplomatic battleground for Brandenburg and Austria trying to exert influence on the elector. Dresden, though devoid of the same cultural pulls as Wien or Berlin, ironically has just as much pull to courtiers. The rulers of Saxony privately joke that their court is filled with more Brandenburger and Austrian courtiers than Saxons. The jape isn't that far from the truth, as the court finds many foreigners within its ranks.\n\nYet this does not prove the handicap that it should. The Saxon court has become used to manipulating the two powers of the Empire against themselves. The most popular method regards gifts given to the elector, each power trying to out compete the other with their generosity. Yet Saxony plays a dangerous game by balancing the powers that hold their independence in their grasp. One misstep and the electorate becomes a footnote in history."
