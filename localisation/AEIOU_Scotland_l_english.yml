 SCOwallacemoment.1.t:0 "War of Rightful Reclamation"
 SCOwallacemoment.1.d:0 "For too long have those English folks stood there, menacingly threatening our border, launching raiding bands and sharing nefarious Republicanist propaganda aiming to undermine our dear Queen Mary's reign. But no more! For now we'll get a chance to teach them a lesson they'll never ever forget.\n\nBorn a Stuart, Queen Mary is a descendant of old English monarchs and as such, she has a birthright for the English throne. Sadly, she relinquished her claim soon after being elevated to the throne, however, long has passed since then and the English are at a breaking point, with their economy n shambles and their political laughing is the common people's laughingstock. \n\nNow, more than ever, is time to end with the English scourge once and for all, and to hail the Scottish flag over the Thames. Like The Bruce once did, we shall repeat!"
