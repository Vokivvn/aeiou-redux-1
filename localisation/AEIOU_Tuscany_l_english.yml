    TUS_fortification_effort_desc:0 "Tuscany is currently undergoing an impressive effort of constructing forts, castles, and many more defensive positions should anyone attempt to invade, namely France and Austria, who have attempted to unite the Italian Peninsula under their yoke. These fortresses go all the way from the Piedmontese border, whose realm will be most certainly engulfed by the mighty Frenchmen to the Westernmost tip of Venice, which is a mere puppet of the liberal despot Rudolf."
