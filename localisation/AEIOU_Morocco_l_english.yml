 Religiousvictors.1.t:0 "Morocco remains!"
 Religiousvictors.1.d:0 "Great news come from the Northern front where our units, masters in sand combat and experts in ambushing the enemy, have absolutely annihilated the foreign colonist and completely routed the defeated Spanish soldiers back across the strait. With their ranks completely decimated and with the morale of the troop below minimum our boys haven't had much progress in turning the Spanish Bull back to where it belongs.\n\nNow reinforced with such a confidence boost our brave men parade in both the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, lost to the invaders centuries prior. We are not, however, as savage as those that inhabited those lands and fearing riots by the natives of Spanish descent we will allow them complete freedom of faith and we will not take their land...for now.\n\nThe Spanish government has yet to make a statement about the peace deal but it should not take more than a few days, or else."

 Religiousvictors.2.t:0 "Celebrating the victors of Ceuta"
 Religiousvictors.2.d:0 "As every year since our great victory against those Spanish imperialists, our people celebrate the "Day of Ceuta" in honour of the brave men that fought in the last battle of the war, which ended with the fall of the aforementioned city.\The veterans are venerated and treated as heroes and the government, ruled by the Sultan, decrees a vacation day for all labourers, something never seen before and proof of the magnitude of the victory. The streets are filled with parties and banquets are set up in every corner. Houses empty to give a start to such joyous celebrations."
 Religiousvictors.2.a:0 "O! Men of Sand, Morocco has a deed with you"
