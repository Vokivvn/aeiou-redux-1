 Pirateexpedition.1.t:0 "The Pirates raid our ships!"
 Pirateexpedition.1.d:0 "The Pirates from what is known as 'The Pirate Coast' are back at it again.\n\nHidden in their small region and protected by treacherous nations like those of Persia and the Ottoman Empire, the Pirates often raid our boats and ships, whose crew most of the time is formed by peaceful travelers and merchants who can't defend themselves. The pirates assault our ships and kill all the passengers just to get some gold and the Spices, which are very expensive and they know that.\n\nPerhaps it is time we unite under a single banner and send a punitive campaign against those savages."
 Pirateexpedition.1.a:0 "We should protect our convoys!"
