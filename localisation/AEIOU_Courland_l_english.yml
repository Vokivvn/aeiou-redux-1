   COUDiplomacy.1.t:0 "The Sale of Fort Bayona"
   COUDiplomacy.1.d:0 "We've just received an envoy carrying a message written by King Charles XI of the French himself. In that message he proposed the idea of selling our colony of St. Andrews - Fort Bayona to them. They argue that in the current sociopolitic ambient that we are living in, with the Russians readying themselves and arming their troops to take advantage of the Holy Roman disinterest in Eastern affairs, the French monarch believes that we would be inclined to sell our African property in exchange of great economic aid and guarantees of French support in the upcoming conflict that will surely erupt sooner or later.\n\nUp to just recently St. Andrews was a synonym of Ivory and pride for our country, but ever since the Swedes lost all of their market and in turn we lost our market in Sweden the colony has proven to be more of a nuisance than a helpful hand for the economy. We could always repurpose it and meddle in the Atlantic Slave Trade, moving our units from Africa to Trinidad, our Caribbean colony, but currently we must put our focus in some more important and urgent matters so even if we wanted to actually do something with that piece of land it wouldn't be until the early 90s or even later, so is it really that important?
