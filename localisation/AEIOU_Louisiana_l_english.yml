 LOU_native_raiding_band_desc:0 "From the Comanche in the south to the Lakota in the north, from within and without our sparse settlements and trading posts are plagued by raiding parties. Crossing our borders from the west or operating from camps hidden in our territory's many remote areas, raiding parties have become part of Louisianans' daily lives. Sometimes what militia or military in the area may drive them off, but they soon return. Sometimes, these warbands' victims will be known only through their absence: a caravan that never arrived or a trading post that hasn't filed taxes. These raiding parties take what they can: food, tools, weapons, scalps, and leave only death and destruction in their wake.\n\n They must be dealt with before more are lost."
