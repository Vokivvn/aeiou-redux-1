 AEIOU_NAME:0 "A.E.I.O.U."
 AEIOU_DESC:0 "Austria owns the world."
 AUS_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Habsburg Monarchy, colloquially known as 'Austria', is in fact composed of a myriad of feudal domains ruled by the Archduke of Austria (and Holy Roman Emperor). It stands as perhaps the most powerful power in Europe in 1886, and has a myriad of posessions from the Habsburg ancestral lands near the Rhine to the West to the rocky mountains of Transylvania. Furthermore the influence of the Habsburgs extends well beyond its borders with significant dynastic ties worldwide, giving the monarchy significant prestige. Yet for all that the Habsburg Monarchy has remained virtually unchanged in its structures for centuries: manioralism and clericalism are still the primary factors of the country. The result being that the Habsburg Monarchy runs with difficulty. The energetic Emperor Rudolf III has however set to change this and to propel Austria into the dominant power in Europe whilst at the same time implementing what he calls 'enlightened government'. But time is flying fast and very few share Rudolf's optimism: should he fail in his task, Austria and the world system she has established may collapse."
 ENG_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Republic of England is certainly the black sheep of Europe. For the past two hundred years it has survived through the exploitation of the North Sea trade, in partnership with the Dutch and the Hanseatic League. Devastated by the Civil War, internal division and several Anglo-Scottish wars, England is, well, just a shadow of what it could have been, a regional power and nothing more. Even though it lost a great deal of its power and prestige with the loss of Scotland, Ireland and the still nascent American colonies, England has not forgotten that its destiny is, it seems, to rule the waves. Despite all its issues, England still remains a potent power in Europe, and it only takes the right circumstances for it to happen..."
 FRA_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of France, led by the energetic Charles XI, is in a dire situation. Surrounded by Habsburgs and with the possibility of expansion on Europe cut off he has decided to expand elsewhere and bring prestige to the French Crown once again; with this, he has engaged in a expansionist policy in North America, where he is the sole leader, and is looking towards securing his position in Africa.\n\nThis, of course, does not mean he has forgotten the main front, and has been strengthening the bond between the Commonwealth and France over the last few years, should a war come."
 OTT_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire is not in the best position, but it could be far worse. Having lost all of its possessions in Europe, where for centuries it ruled with an iron fist, and plundered it, it is now content with Anatolia and the Middle East, licking its wounds like a wounded wolf, getting ready to strike again.\n\nThe Middle East is not the best place for economic developement, with a lack of arable land and an abundance in utterly useless resources such as sand and tar, yet the Middle East is the crossroad of civilization, bathed by the Red, Black and seas Mediterranean. Will the Empire be able once again to dominate Europe or will it instead opt to develop its Asian and African lands?"
 PLC_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is in a rough position with enemies on all sides. Austria, Sweden and Russia all want a piece of the "Sick Man of Europe" whose decline has only been salvaged by the influence of France, their only ally, but this alliance isn't merely diplomatic: All the wars their country has been thrown into have taken a heavy toll on the economy and with crops burnt and villages ravaged there is no place for commerce to rise so a crisis has emerged over the last decades.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian puppet states of Courland-Livonia, Polotsk and Ukraine are just but a mere wooden palisade to keep the Swedes and Russians away and the decentralized Commonwealth's army, whose inefficacy and inability for communication is internationally mocked.\n\nOn the other hand, something that all citizens, to the last of them are proud of, no matter its location or language is King Wladislaw, who is possibly the most popular of Europe, and it is common knowledge that every noble would fight for this kind man."
 RUS_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Tsardom of Russia, ruled by Alexander III of Romanov, is a traditional feudal state. Not having seen any major reforms since the rule of Ivan IV, Russian society has been stagnating and most of the Tsar’s policies are arranged by Boyars, who have been getting more power throughout the rule of Alexander’s father.\n\nRussia is seen as a savage state by most of Europe’s monarchs, it’s not regarded as a regional power after having lost the Great Northern war to Sweden and its European and even Asian territorial claims are often dismissed. Will the Tsardom be able to regain its long lost glory and stabilize its internal affairs?"
 SWE_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Swedish Empire, ruled by the rather uninterested Queen Carola is the predominant power in Northern Europe, having crushed Norway, Denmark and Russia along the way. Their success in the Great Northern War proved for the first time that Russia could be subdued and although later a coalition between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russians would diminish their grip over the Baltic the Empire is at the height of its power. Controlling the Gold Coast's Ivory trade and having a huge influence over the Hansa there is no reason to think that this vast realm's market could crash, is there?"
 SPR_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Spanish Empire, ruled by Emperor Felipe VI of the Spanish Habsburgs is one of the major powers of the world, and currently one of the two nations with strong colonies in Asia and Africa, the other being the Portuguese Empire. Its rule over the Caribbean is uncontested and its relations in India and Southeast Asia are impeccable. The Latin-American countries, who descend from the Spanish colonists that arrived after the discovery of America were granted a lot of autonomy as a period of Crisis erupted in the 17th century in mainland Spain, but they are still in good terms with their previous master.\n\nOn the other hand, Spain, France and Austria could be called "The Powderkeg of Europe" as for the last hundred years they have been fighting each other in an attempt to break the stalemate of powers that emerged after the expulsion of the Ottomans from Europe. Many inconclusive battles have led to a population tired of war and ready to arm themselves against conscription and nobles despising the Emperor's authority to raise the levies."
 CHI_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Qing Empire, ruled by the Sacred Emperor Guanxu, is a thriving country whose ability for commerce almost surpasses its military capabilities. Engaged in friendly relations with the Portuguese and with commercial ports in Spanish Formosa, it is no doubt that its influence is well extended over West Pacific. However, the Qing Empire isn't the most united country and many of its nationalities, like the Miao, the Manchurians and the Mongol and Tibetan vassal states want their independence and have caused quite a stir in the last few years."
 SWE_AEIOU_DESC:0 "The Swedish Empire, ruled by Queen Carola, is the most dominant of the Scandinavian realms, having crushed Norway, Denmark and Russia along the way. Their success in the Great Northern War proved for the first time that Russia could be subdued and although later a coalition between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russians would diminish their grip over the Baltic the Empire is at the height of its power. Controlling the Gold Coast's Ivory trade and having a huge influence over the Hansa there is no reason to think that this vast realm's market could crash, is there?"
