 ENGFlavour.1.t:0 "The Martinet of Albion"
 ENGFlavour.1.d:0 "London - It has been nearly a month since renowned politician and writer George Bernard Shaw announced the release of his latest work, the Martinet of Albion. A page-turner about the Civil War in England that pitted brother against brother so long ago. The event that made the Republic into what it is today is presented by Shaw with a twist. The armies of the dreaded Royalists are victorious and drive all the way to London. In a surprising reversal, the men of the Parliament are beaten at every turn and Charles I takes the throne by force. Assured in his victory, the new king began to gather all the power to himself, stripping away the rights of the people of England to place them under his boot.\n\nSoon the Mad King even revokes the Magna Carta, the document which had set the precedent for so many laws and rights after its time. Perhaps worst of all, after the death of Charles I, his son took the throne. While his father was an oppressive dictator, embodying all the greed of the nobles, his son is a Papist zealot of the worst variety. In the book, Charles II stripped away all rights to worship God how it was intended and forced the people of England to bow before his overlords in Rome. And that is where our story takes place.\n\nShaw has us follow along with the story of the baseborn son of the Bishop of Canterbury, a young teenage boy named Thomas. Having to overcome his birth, Thomas leads us on an adventure through the English countryside. Readers throughout England have been captivated by pictures of oppression and corruption that are scattered throughout the book, worried that this is what their life would have been like if they did not live under the Republic. The clergy living off the poor, Barons warring constantly over land and resources, and Thomas of Canterbury wading through all this filth.\n\n On the final chapter we are offered a glimpse of the future of England and Great Britain. The Kingdom of Great Britain becomes the worlds preeminent power, conquering large swaths of India, Indochina, North Africa and South America. Despite this success, Great Britain becomes one of the world's most autocratic states, mocked by larger, more liberal, European power. The book ends with a glimpse into the final evolution of Great Britain: a noble named Oswald Mosley takes control declaring Great Britain the successor of Rome and promising to 'conquer the entire world for the glory of the Anglo-Roman Race'. The book finally ends with the coronation of Mosley as Emperor of Rome in AD 1966, and the end to British Freedom.\n\n Shaw now records one of the best selling books in the Republic. Even the Lord Protector of the Republic of England, Charles Dilke, has picked up the book. Already the book has become an icon of English freedom and has been used by many notable politicians in their speeches against the evils of despotism and the threat of the Stuarts. Shaw has been able to grab the attention of an entire nation by presenting a harrowing and grim future, and all of England eagerly awaits his next work..."

 ENGMarketcrash.1.t:0 "God has punished England"
 ENGMarketcrash.1.d:0 "It must have been god's wrath's fault that our already damaged country is now in complete rubble. Prime Minister Dilke adressed the populace of London with a shadowy voice in a speech regarding the most recent of events: The Swedish Market Crash. Of course, we cannot comprehend to which extent it has affected the Swedes, but what we do comprehend is that the situation in the entire north, excepting that of Denmark and its satellites, is one of great toil and despair, not only for us. Half of our valuables were centered around the shipping of goods and our navy was once one of the very best at protecting it from all kind of pirates, privateers and other scumbags from afar. Now we've been forced to sell off our goods and search for greener pastures. Of course, half of our goods are now left unvaluable so we've better do something quick before inflation kills off our currency and what's worse: Triggers the Welsh's anger, which isn't something anyone wishes.\n\nIt is certain that all of these hardships will cause distress to the people, which in turn, will be directed towards the leadership of the country. This could be a time for the Monarchists to gather support for a rising against our dear Republic, using the suffering of thousands as their base for conflict and violence."

 ENGScotland.1.t:0 "The wrath of the Scotsmen"
 ENGScotland.1.d:0 "Those treacherous Scots and their cowardly Queen have done it again! Taking advantage of the weak situation our country finds itself in, both politically and economically, Queen Mary the third of her name, may it be cursed, has renegated of our previous truces and peace accords and has proclaimed her birthright to our throne once more. \n\nSkirmishes are having place everywhere on the border and the first enemy units have already begun crossing towards our northern strongpoints. Now we must rally for our cause, a cause of freedom and republicanism, and unite our peoples against a common cause.\n\n'Where's thy braveness, o Scotland, when thou dost backstab thy fallen foe?'"
 ENGScotland.1.a:0 "Show no mercy!"

  eng_collapse_bruh_desc:0 "The economy of this country has been completely obliterated by the collapse of the Ivory Market trade and all of its subsequent changes. It will take years of slow progress and a lot of inversion from the government to reverse this horrific situation.\n\nIn the meantime, due to this uncertainty, the population looks for more drastic measures, further and further away from the moderate leadership, hoping that these drastic changes might help them in any way."
