 AUS_CARL_MENGER_DESC:0 "§YParty: [GetHOGPortraitLeaderIdeology]§!\n\nAppointed as Chancellor when his friend and former pupil, Rudolf, ascended the throne, Menger has been put into the seemingly impossible task to 'modernize Austria'. Menger was born in Poland in 1840, but having ties with Austria, he was sent to study Law in the University of Prague, eventually ending up in the University of Vienna. Carl however was not born a lawyer and instead of pursuing a career of a jurist, he decided instead to focus on journalism. During his period as a journalist he lived very poorly and had to operate semi-clandestinely. When he was not at work, Menger spent his time extensively reading and he became deeply interested in how the economy worked. Influenced by John Locke and Adam Smith, he nonetheless began to deviate from accepted thought and form his own ideas. It is in the 1870s that Menger finally met his fortune, by receiving professorship in Vienna and becoming a tutor to Archduke Rudolf. The two of them formed a friendship that would be conserved thereafter.\n\nIt was then only natural therefore when the newly-crowned Kaiser appointed his tutor and friend as Chancellor. Whilst Rudolf has his vision for Austria, it is Menger who will have to translate the vision into concrete actions. He has a very difficult job ahead of him, but at the same time he is given the opportunity to reshape Austria, both politically and economically. Menger is in a position which many can pitty, but others can envy. It will be up to Menger to show to the world how feudalism can be destroyed..."

 GENERIC_2_HOG_DESC:0 "§YParty: [GetHOGPortraitLeaderIdeology]§!\n\n [GetHOGPortraitLeaderName] has had a relatively long time within the state's politics and outranks many of their peers based around their experience in the field. In recent days, they have proven to be the most efficient at the formation of both domestic and foreign policies but both the industrial and military sectors seem to be lacking without the help of government support.
