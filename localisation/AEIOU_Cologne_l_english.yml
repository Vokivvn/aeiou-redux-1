  kol_idea_teutonic_influence_desc:0 "The Archbishopric of Cologne ends up swearing allegiance to both the Holy Roman Empire and the Teutonic Order in a very complicated process of fealty. Wilhelm Franz von Hapsburg is the Deutschmeister, or order master for Germany. He under the direction of Konigsberg manages the german estates and holdings within Germany and to a greater extent the Archbishopric. At the same time, the Archbishop is beholden to the Emperor and it is to him that the main source of fealty is owed. It is certainly a difficult dance to do for the elector, but he has done well so far.\n\nImportantly, by being directly acclimated with the Teutonic Order command structure and customs, they have taken control of the Archbishopric itself. Like the order, knightly traditions are very prevalent and promotion by merit continues to play a large role within the domain. The neighbors of the elector worry that they follow too closely with the order and that the Grandmaster has control over an elector in the Empire."

  kol_idea_affluent_diocese_desc:0 "Like most of the ecclesiastical rulers within the Empire, the Archbishopric of Cologne is allowed to collect taxes within its domains and keep a vast majority of the funds that it collects. Normally such actions allow the holdings to maintain themselves, yet the Archbishopric has thrived because of it. One of the most profitable realms in the Empire despite its smaller size, the archbishopric collects more than any other smaller prince. Successive bishops have invested the money into the countryside and making loans.\n\nBeyond that, they have made a number of less than above board loans, often to other princes within the empire. All of these revenue sources have allowed the elector to finance a number of ventures. The armies used to protect the domain are well equipped and paid, and infrastructure is well kept and prosperous. The main investment is the expansion of the actual church to accommodate more and more worshipers."

  kol_idea_rote_funken_desc:0 "Originally the city of Cologne was separate from the bishopric, considered a free city in the Empire. Yet time has seen the two joined together, and the Archbishopric hasn't abolished all the traditions from the city. The foremost of this was the Rote Funken or Red Sparkes, the city guard of the city. So-called because of the bright red uniforms they wore, the outfit was incredibly well trained and well equipped. Ironically one of their duties was to keep the bishop of cologne out of the city.\n\nTimes have since changed and the Rote Funken have joined in the purpose of keeping the Archbishopric safe from any aggressors. While a small detachment of the greater army they still retain most of their traditions. This includes being the most well trained in the army, and the bishop makes sure that these very visible troops are always well equipped. Despite being more integrated into the army they still retain the traditions of the merchant class of the city of Cologne, much to the chagrin of the bishop."
