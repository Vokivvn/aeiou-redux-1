 story_news_events.1.d:0 "Constantinople - Jubilation has erupted throughout the capital of [GRE.GetNameDEF] as the long awaited heir to the throne has been born. Although the Queen Maria had much trouble in giving birth, the crown prince nonetheless was born healthy and full of strength. The Crown Prince's baptismal will occur in a month's time at the Church of Saint Sophia, where he will be named 'Karl' in honour of his grandfather, Karl Ludwig.\nThe heir is expected to be placed under the protection of his mother and to be raised as a proper Orthodox, away from his father's malicious influence, in order for him to become an exemplary Christian monarch: devout, charitable, kind and competent. As he is expected to become the protector of Eastern Christendom he will also be taught the art of war, the languages of his realm, the art of rhetorics and the necessary sciences for him to lead his country. The Crown Prince has a bright future."

It is hoped that Sweden will recover quickly."

Mr. Tesla has received appraisal by the scientific community but he has also been accused by the clergy of 'trying to play God'.\nIt is yet unclear what uses this will have, but Mr. Tesla said that 'they will revolutionise every aspect of human life'."

It seems like the Dayak tribesmen, natives of the island of Borneo have decided to cross the Kalimantan forests and mountains once again and have started a pillaging campaign.\n\nThe Dayaks and Bruneians have been fighting each other for centuries in what is known as the Bruneian-Dayak wars, and with the beginning of this conflict the count goes up to four. According to Bruneian sources several of the outposts have been raided and their surprised defenders overwhelmed. The sources also claim several other accounts of horrible tortures made by the Dayaks, citing their "uncivilized" nature but the unbiasability of those who report them isn't easy to prove coming from such a remote part of the world. We can only wait and see how the situation unravels.."

In that one moment, the eruption of chaos through uncertain has reared its ugly head. What is to come next?\nThe Centroamerican parties collectively held support in dictator Mendizabal's leadership, as he reinforced compromise with the lot to assure a delicate balance can be maintained for the central American people to remain united. Now, we can certainly anticipate the secession of Nicaragua, and not hold doubt in more secessions to transpire, ending the united state.\nWhat of Kenner Sanchez? In the haze of confusion as his guards sought to hunt him down, a man was shot and injured, being brought into custody, though he claims no knowledge of the incident. This apparent look-alike is rumored to have been intentionally planted by the co-conspirators. This leaves the pro-Mendizabal faction demanding justice from the Nicuagrans."

Though given this, one can speculate that the dissolving of councils that has affected rural communities the most has stirred silent, vengeful dissent as the rural communities become victims of further policies without any means to give opposition.\n\nSince the discovery, Kenner Sanchez was apprehended during his transit to Guatemala. He awaits his sentencing as Calixto has issued a manhunt for all co-conspirators to bring down the plot entirely. With that, the region of Nicaragua can anticipate an increase in Centroamerican military police presence."

Following the exit of San Salvador, the last remaining piece of the old establishment, Barrundia has seen himself abandoned without any popularity in a region where he is not liked and surrounded by stronger factions and both the Mexicans and the Spanish knocking on his door in an attempt to get something out of all this chaos.\n\nOnly time can tell how this situation will end."

Felipe VI has always been a loyal servant of the Catholic church but his recent actions have made him look like a crazy zealot more than a stable monarch; at least in the world's eyes. The Spanish nobility and population isn't very happy with their new set of laws but they are celebrating their king's new title as if their lives depended on it.\n\n Now we can only wait and see how far Felipe's ambitions can go, and simply hope that they won't result in a war in the near future."

It seems that the Spanish navy has bombarded a neutral Chinese port in retaliation for a fight that didn't actually happen. \n\nRecently, two Spanish ships somehow managed to make each other believe that the opponent was a Chinese ship boarding a Spanish port and when both ships failed to meet each other's demands they fired on each other, killing their own comrades.\n\nIt seems that admiral Fernando Calatrava, captain of one of the ships, didn't get the news that he had fired on his own men, or maybe, he knew but wanted to force a Spanish-Chinese conflict, sources vary. Claiming 'revenge for his dead men and the damage done to his ship' he sailed what was left of his group and bombarded the Chinese port of Fuzhou, who hadn't actually done anything in the previous fight. Several hundred have been killed and many more are wounded and missing; half of the city is burned down.\n\nThe Spanish headquartes have made a plea for pardon and have executed Calatrava for crimes against civilians. Heavy reparations have been paid to the Chinese civilians and the Chinese leadership is inclined to ignore the event and not mobilize because of the quick positive response."

The Spanish concession of Hong Kong has been put under siege and it is expected to fall in the near future.\n\nThe Spanish head of state has not made any declarations yet."

Just like the Roman Empire did a thousand years prior, the Spanish government had promised most of the unit's soldiers emancipation if they enlisted in the army. Thousands of young men joined immediately and the result has been incredible. Europe now looks at the renewed Spanish might with fear and surprise.\n\nIn the treaty signed after the peace plea the Spanish have taken over the island of Hainan, putting it under the Spanish East Indian governorship's control.

Cuba was once part of the Spanish West Indies, one of the many Spanish colonial posessions but now its ruler Joaquín Jovellar has proclaimed an independent 'republic'. The motives are not public but it is easy to claim that he is opposed to the new Spanish regency and supports the restoration of Felipe as king.\n\nNow that war has broken out the Spanish army has to mobilize all of its resources and it will take them some time, of which the Cubans will be sure to take some advantage."

The jungles of Central Cuba have been abandoned to the Native tribals, who now govern themselves in anarchy due to a lack of a central government\n\nWhat the Spanish expected to be a mere revolt has developed into a full fletched revolution which the Cubans, lead by their well experienced leader Joaquín Jovellar, have surprisingly won.\n\nDespite having signed a peace treaty the Spanish have not officially recognized the new nation and just claim it to have been a coup against the current regime as Joaquín Jovellar is know to have revolted for Felipe's cause, the dethroned Habsburg king of Spain. It is not know what will happen now to the Jewel of the Caribbean but one thing is certain though, it will not retain its status as commercial superpower for most of its industry and beautiful landscapes have been completely devastated by the brutal war.\n\nThis is what war does to your country, ladies and gentlemen."

The Spanish government has not sent a formal declaration of war and now faces international backlash, with Pro-French factions in all of the European countries growing day by day demanding the support of such a gallant defendant, who had not done anything to threaten the Spanish beast.\n\nKing Felipe, in a recent proclamation made in the capital city of Madrid, mentioned the need of expansion of Spain to improve its commercial abilities but, however, this may not be the most civilised way to achieve so.\n\nNow the world watches as the two countries fight and hopefully, this engagement will result in a mere border war and will not evolve into a fully-fleshed combat in the main border of the Pyrinees, where thousands of men would be expected to freeze to death."

Titled Antes del Incendio, the odyssey features an 1881 unbenounced to many others in which the mythological Great Library remains unscorched and the Roman empire had successfully stopped the Ottoman empire at the gates of Constantinople. The story follows a courageous nomad named Felipe Martín hoping to seek it rich in a resource unlike any other; coal, the lifeline of the mighty empires. Along the way, Felipe encounters many groups that also want to get more out of this coal rush through the elimination of competitors via swords so powerful; they can break any armour and guns so mighty; they can pierce a hundred men. Javier has also tried to incorporate some of the latest technological advances into his novel through projecting the use of horses that run on coal and boats that use the power of steam. Even though Antes del Incendio remains popular, only time will tell if it is a great work of art."
