 ca.2.d:0 "What misfortune has struck Cetroamerica! With a moment’s strike, Kenner Sanchez, a Nicaraguan nationalist, buried a knife in Calixto Mendizabal’s chest. In that one moment, the eruption of chaos through uncertain has reared its ugly head. What is to come next?\n\nThe Centroamerican parties collectively held support in dictator Mendizabal’s leadership, as he reinforced compromise with the lot to assure a delicate balance can be maintained for the central American people to remain united. Now, we can certainly anticipate the secession of Nicaragua, and not hold doubt in more secessions to transpire, ending the united state.\n\nWhat of Kenner Sanchez? In the haze of confusion as his guards sought to hunt him down, a man was shot and injured, being brought into custody, though he claims no knowledge of the incident. This apparent look-alike is rumored to have been intentionally planted by the co-conspirators. This leaves the pro-Mendizabal faction demanding justice from the Nicaraguans."

 ca.3.d:0 "With great luck and God on his side, a plot was discovered that held the intent to bring an end to Calixto Mendizabal’s life.\n\nCentroamerica’s dictator has ruled the unified state of vying factions, cultures, and peoples with a firm and mindful hand that has allowed reforms in leaps and bounds to ensure prosperity for the whole of Centroamerica. Though given this, one can speculate that the dissolving of councils that has affected rural communities the most has stirred silent, vengeful dissent as the rural communities become victims of further policies without any means to give opposition.\n\nSince the discovery, a Kenner Sanchez was apprehended during his transit to Guatemala. He awaits his sentencing as Calixto has issued a manhunt for all co-conspirators to bring down the plot entirely. With that, the region of Nicaragua can anticipate an increase in Centroamerican military police presence."

 ca.13.d:0 "It has been several days since the Spanish armies located the Condominium of Yucatán begun doing manoeuvres near our border, something they didn't dare to do in the times of Centroamerica. The peninsula of Yucatán, once part of the Viceroyalty of Spain just as us, wasn't as lucky as we were in the independence and was caught in the crossfire between loyalist militias and the recently organized Mexican military. When the war ended it was agreed to divide the power between Spain and Mexico, and thus, the Condominium was founded. This dual power system didn't last for long as the Mexican diplomats and politicians can barely pose a minor threat to the huge Hispanic majority.\n\nIt is this majority now who is likely to make a move on our coastal domain of Puerto Barrios, the diamond of Centroamerica as it was called before its desintegration. There had already been attempts to seize the city during the Independence War and the subsequent peacetime but now, with our guns and cannons crippled and our political caste too inept and unready to act with the severity required to stand such a massive enemy as Spain the Yucatanese have begun readying themselves for a final push for our preciated port. Just as they did thirty years prior with La Baliza, another of our irredentist domains, now they wish to take another bite from our country and destroy our achievements piece by piece. We must stand against the invader, even though we don't really have the phisical requirements to do so."
