  tri_idea_university:0 "University of Trier"
  tri_idea_university_desc:0 "While they didn't found the University of Trier the Bishops of Trier have made use of the center of learning since it was created. Because the electorate has had a sizeable amount of money to spare, multiple bishops have decided to take the University under their patronage. This has allowed them to sponsor their monks learning alongside the secular students, getting an education that could be taken back to benefit the Bishopric as a whole.\n\nWhile the conservative Bishopric isn't somewhere where new ideas thrive or are encouraged, having educated ministers has allowed the domain to work efficiently. Taxes are collected well, infrastructure is built to last, and Trier retains some technological innovations from the University. Perhaps the only negative part of the arrangement is how much of a money sink the university is. Constantly asking for an increased budget, the Bishopric feels it needs to provide in order to continuously benefit from the knowledge stored up there."

  tri_idea_church_taxes:0 "Church Taxes"
  tri_idea_church_taxes_desc:0 "The Bishopric of Trier like others within the Empire has been granted the right to collect taxes and keep a vast majority of it for itself. While not the richest diocese around, it still pulls in a sizable amount of funds. Part of this comes from the importance of the diocese in the Catholic faith, being elevated to an archdiocese. Trier has been the seat of the bishop since Roman times and has retained its power over its domains, becoming very effective at taxing its land.\n\nThe rulers of the land have continuously used the extra funds they have received from the taxes to improve their realm. Whether that is upkeep for the roads, expanding the ports along the Rhine, or funding the army that protects the Bishopric, the funds are always put to use. They have become such a part of Trieran finances that not having them would be devastating, many Bishops depending on the constant flow to continue the ambitious expansion of their electorate."

  tri_idea_rhenish_trade:0 "Rhenish Trade Hub"
  tri_idea_rhenish_trade_desc:0 "The trade along the Rhine has always been competitive, possibly because of how lucrative it is as Central Europe has increased in importance. While Trier certainly does not have a monopoly over the trade, the city and the Bishopric as a whole has implemented policy to increase their market share and have thrived because of it. The city of Trier has long been an important stop to pick up new goods from the rest of Germany, and one of the stations to sell those acquired elsewhere along the river.\n\nThe Bishops, knowing that the commerce benefits them directly have made sure to encourage trade along the river in any way possible. Over the years they have expanded the trade port capacity of their city, building more docks and warehouses to accommodate the increased traffic. Most importantly they have decreed that no taxes are levied on goods brought in this way, meaning that the city has become the primary stop for merchants not wanting to pay high tariffs."
