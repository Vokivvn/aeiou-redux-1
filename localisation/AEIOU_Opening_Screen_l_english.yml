 TNO_OPENING_DESC:0 "What is A.E.I.O.U. 1886? This is what probably crossed your mind when you first saw this mod. A.E.I.O.U. is, shortly put, anything you want it to be. The world in 1886 is very different from that you would expect: the Industrial Revolution has not yet happened, religion and autocracy are all-mighty in most of the world and many countries are stronger or weaker.\n\nCurrently you are playing the Rudolf’s Bane version of the mod featuring the ever-lasting Spanish Empire, the inter-continental Kingdom of France, and the powerful Habsburgs that hold great power in Central Europe through both militaristic and dynastic influences. Will you maintain your strength and continue the expansion of your empire, or will you falter with both internal and external matters; Only time can tell. If you encounter any bugs or other issues with the mod, please inform us on our discord page so AEIOU can continue to improve. Thank You!.\n\nThe AEIOU team\n\n\n\n"
