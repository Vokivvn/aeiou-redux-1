    YUCFlavour.1.t:0 "Governor de Saavedra opens the first Newspaper"
    YUCFlavour.1.d:0 "Manuel de Saavedra is two things: a Spaniard and a Catholic. Before he took charge of the administration of the Yucatan, de Saavedra sponsored a number of Catholic newspapers in his home of Valencia. But in his new home of Mérida, the capital of the Yucatan, there are no such newspapers for him to sponsor. For de Saavedra this simply would not do. A month ago two industrial presses arrived on a ship from Genoa. Since then de Saavedra has worked tirelessly to ensure that the first edition of the Diario de Mérida is a success.\n\nAfter negotiating deals with several paper plantation owners, de Saavedra has renovated a government building to serve as the headquarters of his new paper. Over the past month he has hired reporters, commissioned articles, and written to priests, even going so far as to send a letter to Rome. All this to ensure that the Diario de Mérida will be a newspaper for Catholics by Catholics, containing only the most important Catholic and local news. Today the first edition has left the presses and entered circulation. Only time will tell whether the paper will be a success, however reports indicate that already the Diario de Mérida is a big hit among the Catholics of the nation."

    YUCFlavour.2.t:0 "Continental official assassinated!"
    YUCFlavour.2.d:0 "A senior Spanish official has been found dead in the city of Valladolid earlier today. After failing to report to work, members of the Policía Municipal de Valladolid were dispatched to ensure his well being. However when they found him he was far from well. Found lying in a pool of his own blood with two bullet holes in his chest, it appears he was shot after opening the door for his own murderer. It appeared whoever killed him had no interest in his possessions, the only things missing were his keys.\n\nThe Policía Municipal de Valladolid have a smorgasbord of suspects to choose from, whether they be the Táan u je'ela' Maya, the radical condoists, or Mexican nationalists. Despite the wealth of suspects, the Policía are finding little in the witnesses. Even though the murder occured in a densly populated suburb, no one has come forth with information yet and they likely never will. Any potential witnesses likely have the same sympathies as the murderer. Though such murders are not uncommon, the death of such an important official is a major blow to our administration."
    YUCFlavour.2.a:0 "Those damned Mayans!"
    
    YUCFlavour.3.t:0 "Mayan Unrest"
    YUCFlavour.3.d:0 "The Táan u je'ela' Maya and other nationalist Maya groups have continued to cause trouble throughout the Condominium of Yucatan. Demanding independence from both Spain and Mexico, they have organised strikes, marches, and are even suspected in several assasination plots. In some areas Mayan bandits patrol the roads and entire villages refuse to pay their taxes.\n\nRecently the Táan u je'ela' Maya organised a particularly large strike, with Mayan workers and elders gathering in Mérida, Valladolid, and half a dozen other cities. Though such strikes are far from open revolution, they are a severe disruption to our administration, not to mention a disgrace in the eyes of our neighbors. Needless to say this event has been a major setback."
    YUCFlavour.3.a:0 "Someone ought to kill them"
    
    YUCFlavour.4.t:0 "Mayan Sabotage"
    YUCFlavour.4.d:0 "Though unrest is common, acts of rebellion by the Táan u je'ela' Maya and other Mayan nationalist groups are much less common. However reports from the countryside this week inform us that more radical members of the Mayan nationalists have sabotaged a piece of critical infrastructure. This isn’t the first time such an act has happened, and it won’t be the last.\n\nAlready efforts are underway to repair the damaged infrastructure, however it will take some time as the damage was extensive. Several of the perpetrators have been arrested, however several more have escaped into the dense jungles of the peninsula. It is unlikely we will catch them now, but those we have arrested have already been charged."
    YUCFlavour.4.a:0 "¡Nativos hideputas!"
