 spn_brabantian_nationalism_desc:0 "The Brabantians, also known as the Flemish, conform the vast majority of the population in the Spanish held Netherlands and are known for their rebellious actions from the past.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that they have ceased in their mutinous intentions as they recently begun another nationalistic campaign. The Brabantian lands are mostly farming-centered serfdom-guided noble estates and the techniques they use can be traced back to their great ancestors from hundreds of years prior. It is in this ambience of backwardness and complete diplomatic isolation that the new wave of revolutionaries want the younger generations to thrive and they will not stop until the Spanish rule is overthrown."

 spn_sociedad_flamencoespanola_desc:0 "The 'Sociedad Industrial Flamenco-Española' or SIFE, is a newly created entity, managed by the local governors under the guidance of the ruler of Spain by the grace of god, whose aim is to improve the economic situation of Brabant and destroy all remnants of poverty in the zone in an attempt to gather support from the peasantry. Most of its funds will go to the richest classes, as they are the ones that can pay for engines most of the time."
  
  SPRNetherlands.22.t:0 "Reforming the government"
  SPRNetherlands.22.d:0 "After gaining independence in a long a thorough struggle with our overlords; the Spaniards, we are now looking forward to reestablishing diplomatic ties with our neighbours, especially the strong state of France to the south of our border, whose leaders look with ambition to our possession of Lila, which they've claimed. Now that Spain is gone our forces have grown independent but in reality, they aren't much more than a group of armed peasants and a bunch of mercenaries, which can't possibly hold against the might of the entire French War Machine.\n\nWe need to reform and we need to do it fast!
