 AUS_LEADER_DESC_RUDOLF_III:0 "Titles: Holy Roman Emperor; King of Jerusalem (titular); King of Hungary; King of Bohemia; King of Croatia; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Milan and others\n\nRudolf is the most powerful man in Europe. As the monarch of a vast, multicultural empire Rudolf's coronation at just the age of 26 came as a surprise to many. The death of his father, the rather old-fashioned Franz Josef, came as a shock to most of the court and to Rudolf himself. Nonetheless, here he is, in a position he did not expect to have so quickly nor was he ready to.\n\nRudolf was born in a hot summer day of 1858 an even which brought great joy as the Habsburg throne was secured. Over the years Rudolf would come to be attached to his mother, despite the efforts of his grandmother, as his father was often busy with state affairs. Rudolf was drilled to become a soldier, yet was not made to be one, as his forefathers were, but rather to be an intellectual. As time went by and to his father's dissapointement the young prince was taught economics, philosophy and science.\n\nIn 1884 Rudolf was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope for the first time in nearly 400 years. Although Rudolf has never hid his anticlericalism, he used it as an opportunity to present himself as the rightful 'King of Germans', a highly symbolic move and part of Rudolf's policy of 'uniting the German people'. Ever since then Rudolf has been trying to modernize the Habsburg realms, promoting centralization, weakening the nobility and even secularizing church property! Rudolf is an avowed liberal, influenced by the works of several individuals throughout history who have preached for 'equality amongst men'. However Rudolf is seemingly alone in his bid to create what he calls a 'modern state'. The majority of the people are indifferent, the clergy and aristocrats his enemies and even his own family has largely ostracised him with his far off relative, Felipe of Spain saying to him during his father's funeral 'You little boy know nothing about running the state. Once you understand how countries run then you will understand why the institutions that you call silly exist. You will ruin yourself quickly!'./n/nWith such an ominous situation and the dreadful warning, Rudolf has to show that he is not just a theoretician but also a fighting man. Although hes is a reformer he is not a total revolutionary either: he is willing to compromise with the Pope (remaining Christian despite his anti-clericalism) and is willing to keep the aristocracy as long as they are useful to the state rather than living off of it. As time goes by maybe he will not be so alone in his struggle anymore..."
 SPR_LEADER_DESC_FELIPE_VI:0 "Titles: King of Spain; King of Castille, King of Aragon, King of Leon, King of Granada; Marquis of Flanders\n\nFelipe VI is, following Spanish tradition, a zealous and radical monarch.\n\nAfter his crowning as King following the disgraceful events of 1853, which led to Carlos' death, he eliminated all opposition within his realm, imprisoning them and in some cases even excuting them. It could be said that the word "liberalism" has been erased from the Spanish soil, and now the remaining liberals have hidden or else they risk being prosecuted by the empowered Holy Inquisition on the grounds of heressy.\nHe has strengthened the power of the Church and the clergy, making them his Holy Army, guardians of the holiness of Spain, preaching righteousness to the people and eradicating any opposition. His renown as a defender of Catholicism was such that he received the title of "Catholic Monarch" from the Pope, a title last given to Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon following the end the Reconquista in 1492.\n\n Felipe is one of the most powerful men in the world, controlling huge swaths of territory and people, but he will not stop there. He has taken the mantle as the defender of Christendom, and he wants nothing less than to bring the heretics and heathens under the wing of benevolent Catholicism."
 ENG_LEADER_DESC_CHARLES_DILKE:0 "Charles Dilke is, most certainly, a man with a plan.\n\nFilled with the burning need of rebuilding England is now engaging in a campaign of reformism and radicalization against the ones he blames for England's demise; the nobility and the corrupt politicians.\n\nHis point of view of the world has changed over the last few years, and has understood that the opportunity for England to rise is not tomorrow but now or never and because of that has begun preparations to build a new England.\n\nDilke has many enemies. The aforementioned Nobles, centered around the old royal family, who wishes to regain its previous wealth and also the Moderate politicians, who look at him with fear of what he can do. On the other hand, he is beloved by his Radical Party's members and has the support of about half of England.\n\nStill, only time will say what this ambitious man can achieve."
 RUS_LEADER_DESC_ALEXANDER_III:0 "Alexander, like his father and grandfather, was raised to be a strong, autocratic and traditional statesman, who would do anything to keep power in their dynasty’s hands, even if it often results in appeasing the higher classes of the population, especially the Boyars.\n\nThat notion has left quite an impact on the life of Alexander, seeking ways to improve his royal image before his people and Europe and stop being a puppet Tsar of the Boyars, unlike his failed ancestors."
 FRA_LEADER_DESC_CHARLES_XI:0 "Titles: King of France, King of Navarre, Count of Paris\n\nCharles XI of Bourbon is a strong man; just what France needs in this time of chaos. Not as mentally unstable as his southern neighbour and not as free of criticism as his Polish ally his measures have been extremely successful.\n\nUnder his reign France has become even more centralised and even more autocratic. Taxes on nobles have increased, and if they do not follow the royal command they risk ostracisation. These measures have made him popular amongst many the bourgeious, but have also made many noblemen to resent him, like the powerful Duke of Gascony, who poses as the arch nemesis of Charles. Charles has also antagonised the Roman Catholic Church by espousing (not completely) Gallicanism.\n\nOn the diplomatic side, Charles has adopted a policy of continental isolationism, focusing on his colonies rather than on the continent, and has dissapointed the Poles and many minor members of the Holy Roman Empire, who saw Charles as the one that could end Habsburg domination. His father, Jean III, however had a completely different point of view, and wanted to turn France into the world's preeminent power, whether that would be through pacts or through war. He was fairly successful but as soon as he died all was lost. Charles instead finds it prudent to cultivate his colonial empire and the loyalty of citizens rather than engage in continental supremacy."   
 SWE_LEADER_DESC_CAROLA:0 "Queen Carola of Sweden is, to put it bluntly, not a good monarch. Following the success of their predecessors, the Swedish royal family has begun raising lazy, weak kings and queens who do nothing but party and waste the time of their servants.\n\nCarola is infamously known for its lavish parties and its inability to keep its ministers under control; in addition, many of the realm's regions aren't exactly "loyal to the crown" and there is frequent unrest in Finland and Estonia, with the local nobles calling Carola "frail" and "inefficient".\n\nThe only reason the Empire hasn't collapsed yet is Carola's "favourite", that does almost everything she should do. Anton Hjorth is an old servant of the Queen's father, who has no aspirations other than helping the realm and is very popular with the populace. So popular, in fact, that if he wanted, he could maybe overthrow the monarchy with the help of some resented nobles."
 PLC_LEADER_DESC_WLADYSLAW:0 "Not many people would like to be where King Wladyslaw is at the moment, but nonetheless, it is his duty as leader of the Commonwealth to leade the population forward in these difficult times.\n\nLuckily, Wladyslaw has a trick up his sleeve, possibly the only thing his realm has that he can use in his favour, and this is his popularity. Every man, woman and child of the Commonwealth, no matter their ethnicity or class, supports Wladyslaw and would fight to the end for their country!\n\nThe King's measures up to this moment have been focused in the creation of a protection system nicknamed "Chłopicki Line" after his creator: Military Strategis Jan Chłopicki. Apart from that, the economy has seen a positive evolution following the new internationalist policy adopted by the government; which in terms has made envious many of the stagnant Commonwealth's neghbours."
 BAV_LEADER_DESC_LUDWIG_II:0 "Ludwig II of Bavaria is a "Fairy Tale" King. Known for his constant outbursts of wanting to unify Pfalz and expand his territory to the North.  Not many people want to support the Bavarian King with his ideas.\n\nLudwig II became King at the age of 18 when his father passed away. The Bavarian people are tired of Ludwig's constant bickering and how the Habsburgs will one day take over all of Europe. With his constant paranoia and his dreams of violent expansion, many people don't like his ideas and how he leads. This doesn't stop the "Fairy Tale" King from ruling though as he has the support from his Nobles, and he has tried to please them by giving them land in Bavaria.\n\nLudwig is not taken seriously by the Habsburgs or by his neighbors alike, as they just see him as a man driven to madness. With the constant insults of his neighbors and not many people listening to his ideas, he is very frustrated that not many people will listen to him.\n\nTime will only tell if the King will abdicate or give in to the pressure of the nations surrounding him."
 BRD_LEADER_DESC_LUDWIG_IV:0 "Titles: Margrave of Brandenburg, Elector of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nLudwig IV is a cunning man known for his chivalrous attitude and quick thinking. The Magrave has earned a reputation in Brandenburg as a good and generous Christian always in touch with his people but his enemies know that he is also very ambitious. The Margrave of Brandenburg often writes to the states in the Empire, trying his best to sway them into his favor and discredit the Habsburgs, and he has so far managed to bring the majority of the Protestant nations as his allies.\n\nSince Brandenburg is one of the few Protestant states in the Empire, he is resented by the Catholic countries: the Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order, a sworn enemy of protestants, has repeatedly helped the Polish army kill Brandenburgian mercenaries fighting for the Swedish army and is considered perhaps the most virulent opponent of Ludwig. But Ludwig has friends too and despite the Empire's hostility with Sweden, Ludwig has maintained good relations with Queen Carola whom he sees as a natural ally in his fight against the Habsburgs and Catholicism.\n\nLudwig's goal in life is simple: become the Emperor and overthrow the Habsburgs. For him, Rudolf's ascension and his talks of 'reform' had been a great gift and now more than ever is it possible for Brandenburg to become the preeminent power in Germany.\nBut to achieve this Ludwig will have to continue outsmarting his opponents..."
 PAP_LEADER_DESC_LEO:0 "Titles: Pope (Head of the Christian Catholic Religion), ruler of the Papal Domains.\n\nPope Leo XIII is an old man, just who you'd expect to be leading the Papacy and the entire Catholic religion. Having been elected pope in 1878, he has implemented several measures his devout "children"; such as Felipe VI of Spain, his closest ally, have made sure to follow.\n\nHaving toured the Spanish Netherlands in his early years, where his popularity managed to achieve temporary peace between the nobility and the peasantry, Leo learned about the hardships of being a ruler and has ensured the successful application of his benevolent measures; such as diminishing the diezmo, further allowing the peasants to flourish and a new tax management system in which intermediaries have disappeared, minimizing the tax evasion.\n\nPope Leo's rule has been regarded as a 'new Roman renaissance' in the areas of economy and efficiency."
 NAP_LEADER_DESC_FRANCESCO:0 "Francesco of Bourbon, although likeable and friendly, is not a pious man. Having been a devout christian in his youth, following some disturbing events seen in the Colony of Tunisia, he has lost all of his faith in the lord and has become a bit of a cynic and does not even attempt to hide it.\n\nIn a world dominated by religion, especially the Christian kind, this has made him very powerful enemies, but also given him the potential to boost his country's economy by revoking several Catholic tithes. This measures have divided the population; on one side the Clergy and the High Nobility despise him and have already attempted couping Francesco several times but on the other side, the Lower Nobility and the Serfs love him and would try their best to keep him in charge.\n\nAnd what does the Pope, his northern negihbour, say about this? Curiously, the pope has remained extremely benevolent with Francesco, offering him god's pardon several times."
 PIE_LEADER_DESC_UMBERTO:0 "Umberto I is truly a peak example of the kind of Absolutism that rules Europe. There hasn't been a single liberal minister in the government since the 1870s and it doesn't look like there will be any in the near future. Unlike the Spanish Felipe VI, Umberto doesn't need to use his force or threats to get his ministers to do what he wants, nor does he have to combat other political organizations that could harm his reign. He simply has gained the trust of those that could oppose him by hard work and effort and the faction he supports always wins because of this.\n\nThis doesn't mean he is free of criticism, of course, but he simply doesn't care about it.\n\nFollowing his accession to the throne in 1878 after his father's death Umberto decided to enact several land reforms to avoid being treated as a lazy duke like his father. The nobility, of course, wasn't pleased with this and attempted a mutiny but because of Umberto's oratory capabilities they quickly disbanded and returned back to their states.\n\nWhen asked wether he supports the union of the Italian Peninsula under one banner (Savoy's banner) or any kind of expansion his answer is always negative, for he views himself as the guide of his people's destiny and doesn't want to make them suffer more than they already do."
 IRE_LEADER_DESC_SEARLAS:0 "High King Séarlas is a broken man; a shadow of what young Séarlas once was, so full of energy and positive feelings about the country and its development. But nothing remains of that young dreamer. Currently 52 years old and having reigned 30 of those, Searlas has seen the worst of his country: the ineptitude, the reactionary sentiments polluting his population and the slow decay of the institutions.\n\nThe one who once wanted to unite all Ireland under one banner, his banner, now dies slowly but surely painstriken and almost bedridden in his castle in Corcaigh, with his mind only wanting to remember the glories of the past after failing to secure the future. In this ambient of chaos, however, his servants have taken most of his duties and unexpectedly have begun improving the country, piece by piece... and coin by coin."
 TUS_LEADER_DESC_FERDINAND_IV:0 "Ferdinand IV has plenty of ideas, most of them good, and the vast majority of those involve uniting the Italian Peninsula to stand against the major powers; namely France and Austria. Currently sitting between those two giants and with lazy and unambitious Italian neighbours around it is all up to Ferdinand to achieve his goals, and by god he will achieve them.\n\nFerdinand's bright ideas begun long ago, when he ordered the increase of resources spent in the colony of San Lorenzo to get more raw materials to use in future wars. His next idea was the creation of a defensive line in the mountain range from Bologna to La Spezia, just in case.\n\nWith this setup ready, where will Ferdinand put the limit?"
 CRI_LEADER_DESC_ISKANDER_I:0 "Titles: Khan of Crimea; Sovereign of Two Continents; Khan of Khans of Two Seas\n\nIskander Khan Giray, of mixed Gothic and Tatar heritage, descendent of Şahin Khan Giray and Menli Khan Giray, finds himself trapped between the traditional values of the Tatar people and conservative elements of the Ulama.\n\nInheriting a khanate whose existence has always been in the balance and whose domains have shrunken significantly, Iskander hopes to not repeat past mistakes made by his ancestors. Raised within the confines of Shafi’i islamic thought Iskander knows how to use his influence and piousness to his advantage, receiving the blessing and support from the powerful sunni sect of Ulama. However, he had soon found that his supporters within the religious body were among the very ones hampering any progress and advancement for his fledgling khanate.\n\nThe young khan must also fight a battle against his own people.The Tatars look ever inward as many simply want to be left to their own devices. Few have worries about their neighbors beyond what can be taken from the harvesting of the steppe or clan ties. While the khan is popular with the Tatar people, Iskander worries that anything that threatens their traditional lifestyle will lose him the support he desperately needs. Yet with dreams of regaining his dynasty’s old grazing grounds, Iskander pushes a number of small reforms ever onwards.\nThis eagerness has had a mixed effect in the Bağçasaray court. Most of the Giray clan, conscious perhaps that Iskander represents a chance of revival for their family, supports the young khan’s ambitious plans to a point. Iskander has been careful to appeal his modernization to the non-muslim minorities of Crimea. Breaking with tradition, and setting the Ulama on edge, Iskander visited the jewish population at Çufut Kale. Traditional enemies of the Giray clan rise to fight any taking over of their power however. Iskander is sure that the Nogay clan will fight against any reform that threatens the powerbase they have built.\nThe Khan of Crimea will have to tread carefully, as his people and lands lay in the balance and Iskander cannot please everyone."
 WUR_LEADER_DESC_KARL_I:0 "Titles: Duke of Wurttemberg, Count of Tübingen, and Protector of Ravensburg\n\nCharles I, born Karl Friedrich Alexander, commands the regional power of the Duchy of Wurttemberg. His family has always held sway over the politics of Swabian Germany and seeks to expand its power base. The duke has been ruling over his domains for some time now, having inherited them his father William before him. A bastion of conservative and authoritarian thought, Charles runs the court of Wurttemberg as a model of many others around Europe. Recently, Charles has largely concentrated the power within the duchy to himself, becoming almost a despot. The only other power that he allows within his realm is that of the catholic church. Allying himself with the church has allowed for him to have free reign within his dukedom, though some whisper that the Abbot of Zwiefalten holds too much sway over Charles. Confident in the superiority of the nobles Charles leads a campaign to minimize or the power of the merchants of Ravensburg.\n\nThis ideal only goes so far as the Wurttemberg level, however, or at least in the mind of Charles. An ardent opponent of any reform to centralize the Holy Roman Empire, Charles has used his influence with his neighbors to be a general nuisance to the Hapsburg Crown. Yet Charles finds himself with few actual friends. Perhaps reflective of his cold personality, beyond the neighboring states that they can bully, Wurttemberg finds herself alone. A rivalry with the Margraviate of Brandenburg comes as a consequence of Charles identifying himself as a devout Catholic. Charles has connections to both Russia and Spain but whether he can make anything with those connections is largely up to him."
 POR_LEADER_DESC_LUIS_I:0 "Titles: King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India.\n\nLuis II, known to be a luxurious man, is one of the most powerful men in the world. The King often drinks and dines in his palace, not really caring about how people view him. All that the King cares about is his wealth and how he spends it on himself and his family. Having been raised in a rich society, Luis has not been in touch with the common folk. The King's touch with the people is slowly starting to turn into riots in the streets after telling them that they can fend for themselves and that they should be glad that he is their King. This has caused many people in Brazil to gather and question if they should stay loyal to the crown.\n\nIn response to the riots, the King has only made things worse in Brazil. He sent troops to try to quell the riots, which has only caused more outrage in the general public. Even though his advisors have advised him to try to speak to the people, he has only replied that he will not show his face to peasants. Word has spread like wild-fire that the King is elitist and only respects the high society. As more and more people hear about the King and his elitist views, some of his advisors have quit due to public opinion. With all of the tension in Brazil and whispers among the people, the King has a lot on his plate. To add to his plate, Felipe of Spain has tried to pressure the King with diplomacy and his Holy Inquisition.\n\nHis known elitism and luxurious attitudes have earned him a reputation amongst the nobles in Europe. Luis has tried his best to secure an alliance with the French but has failed horribly. The French have only agreed to help the King with helping him against the Spanish. With no help from the French, he is alone with securing the loyalty of his subjects. He now relies on his advisors to help him secure the loyalty of his people and win their hearts. But in order to do that, he has to change his ways of life and listen to his people. The King has no interest of talking to his people and instead, expects his advisors to do this for him. So only time will tell if the King will give in to the pressure of Spain or secure the loyalty of his subjects once more."
 GRE_LEADER_DESC_OTTO_I:0 "Titles: King of the Romans; Duke of Thrace; Protector of the Golden Horn\n\nBorn into the sizeable von Habsburg family, Otto had no interest in ruling the kingdom that he was given in Greece. Used to the rich opulence of the court in Wien, Otto has attempted to make Konstantinoupolis a mirror image. Though large in size like that of Austria, the court of Otto is filled with excess and debauchery. Considered a social paradise by nobles from across Europe to even Asia, the parties that Otto throws within the royal palace are something out of a legend. These constant parties are thrown by the king to cover up his alcoholism. Nothing, however, can cover up the king’s womanizing behavior. Many women in the capital have known the king.\n\nOtto does very little ruling, beyond making sure that his parties are funded from his healthy allowance. The civilian government, not wanting to be associated with the hedonistic image of the capital, does most of the actual governance from Athina. They have been incredibly patient with the king, willing to take in stride his most ardent of behaviors as long as his allowance can be kept in check. However, with Otto requesting an evergrowing sum of money they may tire soon of the foreign king.\n\nThe people of the Kingdom have a strange infatuation with the king. Because most of his more base activities are swept under the rug by the royal court, many of the people see a charming king who is well connected throughout Europe. Many rural peasants dream of being invited to one of the parties thrown in the capital, and meeting their king in person. This, unfortunately, is only a dream, for Otto does not share the love his subjects show him. It is only thanks to his royal advisors that he doesn’t make a misstep with the commoners. His royal advisors realized that the people are a good counterbalance to the government’s dislike of the king, and good insurance that the generous gifts that Otto is able to give them for their service keep coming.\n\nOtto continues to party like every day is his last, perhaps one day it will be."
 CHI_LEADER_DESC_GUANXU:0 "Titles: Emperor of China\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor, born Aisin Gioro Zaitian, though only fourteen leads the largest and most powerful nation in the world. With no natural external enemies and a strong army, the young emperor needs to deal with internal issues that are threatening to tear his empire apart.\n\nHaving many responsibilities and court traditions thrust on such a young boy was more than one can usually take, and Zaitian was no different. The court officials did not truly expect the boy emperor to rule until he was much older, and regents were appointed to oversee the day to day running of the large domain of Qing. The young emperor, as long as he appeared at ceremonial events, was left to his own devices. He would experience an upheaval in his life however as the tutor of his earliest years, Weng Tonghe, was exiled for his part in the disastrous upbringing of Tongzhi Emperor. Kang Youwei was soon sent in to replace him. The new teacher filled the young boy’s head with ideas of reform and bringing the Qing Empire to the modern era. \n\nNearing his fifteenth birthday the Guangxu Emperor has begun to push his officials to allow him to rule in his own right. The ruling regents and nobles are afraid that the emperor will strip away the power that they had accumulated while he was young, though they can find little excuse with not letting him fully take the throne. The ideas that Guangxu has in his head may tip the court factions into action against him.Yet a court full of intrigue is not the only thing that the Guangxu Emperor has to worry about. Though the Qing Empire has friendly relations with its powerful Spanish and Portuguese neighbors, it is internally which the chaos bubbles. Numerous peoples within the empire grow tired of being ruled over by their Manchu overlords. Han, Tibetians, and Mongolians are just some of those who want to be separate from the empire.\n\nWith all of these problems, Guangxu hopes to be the Emperor to heal the ills of the Empire."
 NEN_LEADER_DESC_BOCOCK:0 "Titles: President of New England\n\nThomas S. Bocock is the current president of the Republic of New England, though he finds himself mostly content with the situation that his predecessors had left the Republic in.\n\nBocock grew up in the far north of New England, the sixth son of an important farmer and lawyer. He was able to get one of the best educations available in the west, graduating as the head of the class. Using his connections that he had achieved through his father and through college Bocock was able to start a law practice in the capital city of New Belfast. After practicing law in the capital for some time he would return to Virginia and enter into local politics. The success that he experienced there inspired him to run for President of the Republic. While he did not have the backing of either political faction, his connections carried him through. It did help that the opposition was splitting the ticket.\n\nThomas S. Bocock has little desire to make any great changes to how the Republic has been functioning. He would like to continue the prosperous trade with Swedish Delaware and Massachusetts. Both states have been loyal customers for the agricultural surplus of New England. Thomas S. Bocock’s relations with the natives around him is complicated, however. The tribe of the Cherokee has good relations with the republic and the two have a healthy trade that benefits both of them. They both look anxiously at the French colony of Louisana.\n\nThe Seminole tribe on the southern border of the republic is a different story though. The natives have been a thorn in Bocock’s side since he took the presidency, raids terrorizing business and burning crops. President Bocock readies the small, and inexperienced army to take out the threat of the Seminole so that the southern areas of the Republic can thrive.\n\nThe lawyer turned president is tasked with leading New England as the world around him changes drastically. Only time will tell if the status quo will sustain New England."
 GUA_LEADER_DESC_CALIXTO_MENDIZABAL:0 "President Calixto Mendizabal is a strong, capable man, ready to take on the many challenges that menace the survival of Centroamérica.\n\nCalixto rules over his many subjects with a fair but strong hand, not allowing any dissidents to rise while also permiting the population a fair amount of liberty of expression not many Conservative leaders would allow. Calixto has created an alliance with the Guatemalan political parties, the ones that rule the entirety of Centroamerica, and this way he keeps control of the most important parts of the realm, allowing himself to focus on the nationalists.\n\nSome of his measures have been the creation of an unified post system, abolishing the regional mail  and thus, diminishing the intermediaries and also the abolition of the local councils, something that has triggered anger in the most rural regions but that has gotten Calixto lots of praises from his burgeois allies.\n\nHe most certainly has lots of ideas that could keep the realm united and ready for the coming times, but, should he die before the end of his term, it is very hard to gaze what terrible calamities Centroamérica would face but certainly, they would not go away easily or peacefully."
 SER_LEADER_DESC_NIKOLA:0 "Titles: Prince of Serbia; Prince of Montenegro; Count of Beograd\n\nThe prince of Serbia faces challenges from all sides as he attempts to keep his fledgling state alive, though the country is much at the mercy of the Habsburg Crown. \n\nNo man could be prouder of his heritage than Nikola, and it seems through his force of will alone that the Principality of Serbia stays together. The prince has brought together the highland clans of Montenegro and the merchant class of Beograd to sit together within his court at Beograd. Through his influence the prince has issued a number of reforms, dealing with the lack of education, a poorly organized military, and better infrastructure. While all of these have seen success it has cost the small principality much of its funds. The prospect of bankruptcy for Serbia is a very real threat and Nikolai may need to roll back some of his reforms. \n\nYet the looming spectre of the Austria Empire looms ever over Serbia. Nikola has been attentive making sure that relations with the state are cordial. He makes visits to Wien to renew the vow of friendship between the two, even though his nobles consider it a humiliation. Ever careful when maneuvering around the Austrian court, Nikolai hopes to use the goodwill he has generated to advance his own crown. Nikola hopes that the Habsburg will turn a blind eye to any actions against his neighbors, especially against the Bulgarians who hold land Nikola believes should belong to him.Beyond their friends in Wien the Principality has few allies. The Balkans wish to prevent the erstwhile prince from expanding his domain at their expense, and old rivals stopping for a time. Even the Republic of Venice, of whom Serbia shares a benefactor, does not wish to attach themselves to the Serbians." Nikola must navigate through the dangerous politics of the Balkans and survive the intrigue of the Habsburg court if Serbia is to thrive."
 MAS_LEADER_DESC_DAWES:0 "Titles: President of Massachusetts, Leader of the Conservative Party\n\nBorn to a middle-class merchant family in the small town of Cummington, Massachusetts Henry L. Dawes seeks to expand the influence of the Republic and grow the amount of trade that flows through the Port of Boston.Well-educated and well-informed, Dawes seems the perfect person to lead the Republic of Massachusetts, since the very lifeblood of the republic is commerce. The Port of Boston is one of the largest in the New World, and is the main hub of commerce. Dawes has used the success of the port to boost his own political career, securing the loyalty of his party as well as platacating any opposition within the Massachusetts Assembly. So long as the money keeps flowing through the port, Dawes seems secure in his position.\n\nDawes intends to capitalize on his relatively secure position to push forward his initiative. To the west of the republic lies the lands of the Mohawk and Seneca. With Boston growing so Dawes had determined that land needed to be secured in order for the Republic to continue to thrive. To this end he seeks to integrate the tribes peacefully within the republic. Dawes reasons that the natives would be a valuable part of the republic, able to open the fur trade up that for so long had been dominated by the French colony of Canada. The opposition has come from varied sources to oppose Dawes’ plan. The clergy of Massachusetts, what remains of the puritan sect, has influence over the hearts and minds of the rural families. They would rather take the land by force, giving more land to their supporters and thus more power would flow to them. Hoping to push past the animosity shown by his opponents, Dawes seeks allies in his neighbors. The most obvious choices are New England and the colony of Swedish Delaware, both so closely tied to Massachusetts by trade. Dawes intends to see the Republic prosper."
 HAN_LEADER_DESC_ERNST_AUGUST:0 "Titles: King of Hanover; Elector of the Empire; Count of Gottingen\n\nErnst August II finds himself in a delicate situation as the once stable position of the Kingdom of Hanover is threatened by the politics of the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nThe ruler of Hanover is the very definition of a pragmatic ruler, and his kingdom has flourished as a result. His domains serve as the crossroads between the Protestant German princes and the Catholic princes of the south. As a result, though Catholic himself, his lands hold a number of protestant followers. Tensions between his people should be high, though Ernst has made sure that freedom of religion is thoroughly enforced within his realm. While this has not won him the friendship of the nearby Bishopric of Munster, the man is well-liked by the temporal princes who are his neighbors.Beyond being liked by his subjects Ernst is perhaps more importantly, well thought of by his army. A skilled tactician and a ruler who embodies the martial spirit, the ruler of Hanover early on in his reign realized the importance of the army to the survival of Hanover. Investing the limited capital of the kingdom, the Hanoverian army while small, is well equipped and well trained. Ernst’s father established a military college for army officers in the capital city, and it serves officers ranging from all over Europe. Financing this has been difficult, and other areas of Hanover such as its navy suffers as a result. Ernst has gotten into the practice of renting out whole regiments of his forces, the so-called Guelphic Legion, to the highest bidder to continuously finance his army expansion. \n\nThe King, however, finds himself in a bind. The Bishopric of Munster has been an ardent rival, limiting any influence in the west. In dealing with that thorn in his side the Elector may find more problems spring up, as he may have to choose a side in the tension that is bubbling on the surface of the Empire. The Kingdom of Hanover needs a steady hand to lead it and Ernst believes he is the one to do it."
 VEN_LEADER_DESC_JOAQUIN:0 "Titles: President of the Republic of Venezuela\n\nBorn in the small town of San Francisco de Cara, Joaquin Crespo started his career in the military, slowly but steadily rising to the rank of General in the Venezuelan Army. A strong supporter of the liberal semi-dictatorial Antonio Guzmán Blanco, Crespo eventually earned a choice position as the Minister of War in the former’s cabinet during Guzmán’s second term as President in 1879.This would be the jumping point for Crespo’s political career; using Guzmán’s popularity (and with his blessing), he was able to win the election of 1884 as standard-bearer for the Liberal Party and the declared heir to Guzmán’s legacy. As President, he has done much to maintain the previous actions of Guzmán, upholding the liberal suffrage laws and reforms implemented. However, Crespo’s deferential attitude towards his mentor has led to rumors alleging Guzmán is more involved in his prodigy's Presidency than it seems.In addition to this scandal in the making there is the state of the Venezuelan economy, which had already begun to suffer under Guzmán and has only had its conditions exacerbated under Crespo. Blaming this economic slump on unproductive migrants, Crespo has taken actions to prevent further immigration to Venezuela, hoping this will slow the downward trend in Venezuelan economics.\n\nOn the world stage, Crespo’s tenure as President has seen attempts to decrease tensions between Venezuela and Spain. He has mostly acceded to the occasional demands of the Spanish Crown in hopes of avoiding confrontation with such a large power at a time when Venezuela faces growing unrest at home that could easily escalate further. However, if he serves Spanish interests for too long, Venezuela’s independence may be called into question, and few Venezuelans will accept that without a fight..."
 SAX_LEADER_DESC_ALBERT:0 "Titles: King of Saxony, Count of Dresden\n\nTrapped between the two largest powers in the Holy Roman Empire, King Albert has had to use all of his skills in diplomacy and martial to keep the elector state of Saxony alive. So far he has done a more than the adept job of it.Albert received a well-rounded education, not just focused on military matters as so many german princes did. That being said, Albert fully embraced the martial side, leading his men successfully in the field. Albert finds himself at a crossroads between the old and the new. He is an old man, very old by some standards. Yet, King Albert sees the old traditions and ways dying around him and realizes that in order for his kingdom to survive he needs to embrace the new.\n\nPart of embracing the new is making sure that his army is as battle-ready as possible. He has brought experts in all fields to Dresden to teach his officers the modern ways of combat, expended a large sum of the Saxon treasury to outfit his army. If either Brandenburg or Austria decides to enforce their will, the Saxon army will be ready. In that, he has also inputted his greatest strength as a military leader. When he lead his men he mainly associated himself with the engineers. The old king things that a line of fortifications will deter any would-be attacker.If the army does not dissuade King Albert hopes that his skill in the diplomatic ring will save his kingdom. The old man is a popular figure in both the Wien and Berlin courts, embracing his image as a kindly old man. As he continually binds himself to his neighbors he hopes to play them against each other as much as possible. Perhaps if his army does not deter then the threat of the other great power will. \n\nOverall the Electorate of Saxony is in a position that is both delicate and full of potential. It has a strong army that may develop in strength and it is well-positioned to ally with its neighbors to fight the others. Yet one misstep may see the long lived kingdom lose its independence that it has treasured."
 HOL_LEADER_DESC_CREMER:0 "Titles: President of the United Provinces of the Netherlands\n\nCremer is a man of ambition and a thousand different plans that all seem to be going on at once. With full intention to seize the North Sea trade and expand the influence of the Republic, Cremer mobilizes the public against their neighbors.\n\nThe Cremer family was an important merchant family in the Republic, owning a number of plantations in Suriname. After taking over the family business he would push for greater control over the shipping industry in the Netherlands. With a well-funded base he would become heads of multiple investment firms, with businesses all across the Americas and the East.  After establishing himself as a successful businessman, Jacob would enter Dutch politics becoming President through a close election against the incumbent.Jacob is not a politician by any stretch of the imagination. He has been able to keep his coalition of supporters happy because the Netherlands has thrived off of the North Sea trade which it has the largest market share of. However, the president is not one to allow things to settle and be comfortable and has begun plans to expand the Dutch sphere of influence. Seeing the English and Swedish as loose ends, Cremer wishes to cut them out of the trade completely, taking a monopoly over the North Sea. To accomplish this goal Jacob is willing to use underhanded tactics and ally his nation with countries not traditionally aligned with Dutch interests. Perhaps if it goes well then expansion of colonies is even in the cards, but that isn’t the priority for Jacob.\n\nThe biggest faction of dissidents and opposition to Cremer has railed against his inability to integrate the Spanish Netherlands into the United Provinces. Whether or not this is possible is irrelevant to his opponents as they wish the influence of the Catholic nation to be far away from them. Perhaps opening up diplomatic channels with the French or even the Austrians can something truly be achieved.Cremer has to navigate the many needs of his people if he wants to stay in power."
 SPE_LEADER_DESC_EMILIO:0 "Titles: Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies\n\nThe Governor-General of the farthest East of the Spanish possessions Emilio desires to use the colony as a testbed for his reforms and improvements. He may face opposition from the nearby Shogunate who is wary of any foreign influence and conservative officials in the colony.Emilio would grow up the son of a successful general, who married a minor noblesse despite his old age. Trapped by his father's commoner birth, Emilio would fit in neither with the common man nor the peerage of Spanish. His birth and both parent's influence allowed him to get a commission in the Spanish army. He was sent to the eastern colonies to pacify natives, a task that he took no relish in. Despite his reluctance, Emilio would receive major commendations and promotions for his performance, his subjugation of the Moros being the most famous. During these expeditions, he would take away an appreciation of the colonies and both the Spanish colonists and the natives that he fought against.\n\nReturning home Emilio would grow tired of the noble dominated politics of Spain. While he chafed under the restrictions placed on him, he realized that speaking out would not only not lead to change but get him in trouble. Instead of serving in Spain, he requested that he was transferred to the Spanish East Indies as the Governor. Though his transfer was initially blocked, Emilio used his influence in the Order of Masons to push it through.Free of the watchful eye of Spain, Emilio has used his position to make the Spanish East Indies a testbed for his ideas. He has constructed a number of public works, including expanding the ports in Manila and building a network of roads across the islands. A large number of his funds have also been invested in making a publicly accessed education system in both Spanish and local dialects. The Governor-General has big ideas for continuously improving his domain though he faces opposition from conservative Spanish officials who may find it convenient for him to be replaced."
 PER_LEADER_DESC_NASAR:0 "Titles: Shah of Persia\n\nNasar al-Din attempts to lead the Sublime State of Persia through various internal problems to make it a state ready to face the rest of the world. Hoping to modernize his state, the Shah faces his own boredom and opposition from local tribal leaders.In theory, the Shah of Persia exercises complete authority over the large realm that they oversee, their word being the final law. Nasar al-Din found when ascending the throne, that was not the case. In fact, the Sun Throne of Persia holds very little control of the tribes and religious authorities in Persia, many just de facto following what is decreed. This was none more so asserted in the state of Persia’s army. While not a martial man himself, Nasar was forced to take stock of his armed forces when he became Shah. Instead of the strong force that some of his sycophantic ministers told him he had, he realized that the various tribes and clans had more men than the state army. Something needed to change. While Nasar is apart of the very old guard that he wishes to change, the wishes of the Shah are very fickle. Motivated by his minister Amir Kabir, he has slowly pursued reforms that would hopefully bring Persia into the modern era. These include various modifications to the tax system to make it more efficient, forcing governors to have a balanced budget. Or reforming the state army to make it loyal to the Shah rather than the clans. Most importantly Nasar wishes to wrestle power away from the powerful Ulama, whose tax exemptions and allowances hemorrhage money from the treasury. Yet Nasar watches these reforms progress carefully, and may soon either become bored with the projects or see them as a threat to his power. \n\nWhile the Shah wishes to bring Persia on the world stage he has to deal with his own countrymen. Under the current state of affairs, his words and decrees rarely hold any weight coming out of Tehran. It will become increasingly important to either centralize power or work with Amir Kabir on his reforms. With large shoes to fill Nasar's hopes to bring pride to the Sun Throne once more."
 TAC_LEADER_DESC_MODESTO:0 "Titles: President of Tacna, Governor of the Andes\n\nSince independence from Spain, the Republic of Tacna has sought to carve out its little corner of the world, and at the helm of this project is Modesto Basadre. After spending much of his youth in Europe studying, Basadre returned to his home in the 1840s, filled with knowledge and ambition.Initially Modesto sought to carve out a fortune as a merchant of textiles and alcohol. This proved moderately successful, and he soon began to make something of a name for himself in the Puno Region of the Viceroyalty of Peru. This all changed when the war for independence began, as Basadre’s routes of transport and supply were disrupted by the chaos of war. With the large wealth he already had, Basadre chose to close his business and shifted to supporting the efforts of the revolutionaries. Under the command of Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco Iturralde, the rebels slowly wore down the Spanish until a peace could be signed.Basadre greeted the signing of peace with Spain as a triumphant victory, and initially lived on the fringes of politics, occasionally voicing some strong opinion. Following the collapse of Iturralde’s Junta, which succumbed to pressure following the disastrous war with Bolivia, Basadre threw his hat into the ring for Iturralde’s successor. With connections to both upper-class landowners and various revolutionaries and freedom fighters bolstering his campaign, Basadre easily won the office of the Presidency.\n\nAs President Basadre has strove to maintain cordial relations with the various nations of South America, with one exception-Bolivia. Every Tacnan dreams of avenging the national pride lost to the Bolivians years ago, and Basadre is as much a Tacnan as anyone else. If an opportunity presents itself, there is little doubt the Republic of Tacna will seek to right the wrongs of so many years ago, and few question that it will be Modesto Basadre leading the charge to war when that day comes."
 VNC_LEADER_DESC_GIORGIO:0 "The apple that is Giorgio Manin does, in this case, fall far from the tree. Giorgio’s father, Daniele, was a fiercely anti-Austrian politician who ran unsuccessfully for Doge twice. Daniele despised the overbearing influence Austrians held in Venetian politics, and had throughout his lifetime sought to create a unified coalition of anti-Habsburg Italian states, an endeavor that ultimately had little success.\n\nGiorgio, on the other hand, initially worked as a metallurgical engineer with no political ambitions. This came to an end when he was nominated to the Consiglio dei Pregadi in 1870 after making a name for himself among the city’s oligarchs, men who sensed a promising spirit from him after a few chance meetings. From there Manin’s career skyrocketed, culminating in his election as Doge in 1881 after campaigning to restore Venetian naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Unlike his father, Giorgio has no qualms existing in the pocket of the House of Habsburg. Shortly after his election, he traveled to Vienna seeking Austrian assistance with his naval build-up plan. After convincing his benefactors and receiving a generous loan from them, he returned to Venice, keen on putting his plan into action. Since then he has constantly collaborated with Austria to ensure he (and Venice as a whole) remains on their good side.\n\nWhile his diplomatic skill has endeared Manin to many of the wealthy oligarchs who wish to see Venetian prosperity further revitalized, his closeness to Austria has pitted him against the small faction of radicals who wish to see Venice retain its independence fully. While this group has traditionally been of little importance, in recent years they have capitalized on Venice’s weakness as a sign that total independence is the future of the Serene Republic."
 NIC_LEADER_DESC_CARDENAS:0 "Born upon the shores of Lake Cocibolca in 1836, Cárdenas studied medicine in Genoa in his youth. Returning to his homeland after the end of the war with Spain, he quickly became involved with a number of high-ranking Nicaraguan officers of the Army, Tomás Martínez Guerrero in particular.\n\nHis clear thinking and love of the country of his birth caused him to become fairly popular with such men as these, and he also quickly came to have a grasp on the military matters which they often discussed. The most pressing topic of all for the officers was the apparent exploitation of Nicaragua for the profit of the other areas of Centroamerica. \n\nHaving been declared the ruler of the new Nicaraguan state, Cárdenas is now in a difficult position. As the first nation to break away from Centroamerica, Nicaragua is perhaps a little more organised than their new neighbours, but the road ahead will not be easy for the new president and his compatriots. With those around him looking hungrily at the natural resources of Nicaragua and the constant threat of Spanish aggression and domination, he must put his prodigious skill to work in organising the armed forces and attempting to forge a nation out of the land he so much loves."
 ELS_LEADER_DESC_GUIROLA:0 "Born in 1826 to a Spanish father and a Salvadoran mother, Guirola spent much of his early life in Zacatecoluca, until he was sent to study in Guatemala, where he worked in a pharmacy for a number of years. However, he was an ambitious man, and invested in the international indigo trade, where he made a small fortune. As one of the premier businessmen of Salvador he profited greatly from the French funding during the war with Spain, but found that his profits began to suffer under the unfavourable trade deal that was forced on Centroamerica by the Spanish.\n\nSince then, he has tried to invest his wealth elsewhere, and in 1880 founded a basic financial institution, offering loans to landholders in exchange for a share of the profits they produce. This venture has grown massively, culminating in him earning the nickname ‘The man who owns El Salvador’. \n\nIn the wake of the assassination of Calixto, he seized power by calling in debts, mirroring the Nicaraguan move to become independent. Now he faces enemies on all sides, as he tries to oppose the Spanish imposition of unfair trade deals, outmanoeuvre his new neighbours who seek the wealth of the plantations that exist thanks to him, and try to face down the internal enemies like the generals, who are greedy for the wealth he is earning."
 HON_LEADER_DESC_PONCIANO:0 "Born in Santa Barbara in 1821, Leiva has been a military man for the vast majority of his life. Having enlisted as a mere soldier, he excelled in every position he received, and climbed quickly to be promoted to general in 1859, despite his low birth, thanks to his great contributions to the war effort against Spain. Since that time he has been invaluable to the army, issuing a number of reforms and making efforts to professionalize the army.\n\nLeiva has always had a dim view of the Spanish army and often advised the government to throw off the shackles of the treaty. Beyond this, he finds it shameful to the army that the government never even gave them a chance to prove their ability to protect their independence. Thanks to this, he was generally seen as an idealist, with little political acumen, and never found the political power that he wished to achieve.\n\nWith the death of Calixto, Leiva first attempted to rally local armed forces to retake Nicaragua. However, seeing the power he had long desired within his grasp, he instead turned and declared himself to be the president of Honduras. Now he looks to expand his power and hopes to be able to finally free himself and his nation from the weight of the Spanish upon their backs."
 LOS_LEADER_DESC_BARILLAS:0 "Born in 1845 as the son of a general, Barillas was brought up to join the army.  As one of the first of the new generation of young officers following the war, he had a tendency to a more radical perspective than others. Where the older generations were focused on the domination of Spain and tried to re-fight old battles, Barillas and his young compatriots wanted another war – and saw opportunities for much to be gained in Mexico, to the north.\n\nHowever, after an ill-thought conspiracy aimed at beginning the conflict they desired, Barillas narrowly avoided being declared a bandit by both Mexico and his own homeland, and given a post in a rural area high in the Guatemalan hills. This embittered him against his own nation, and especially against the politicians. \n\nNow with the fall of Calixto he has now emerged with a sizeable contingent of young officers and, following the example of his southern neighbours, has declared the state of Los Altos. Now he looks to the north, hoping to be able to seize land from Mexico while also defending himself against attack from the south. However, he is in a vulnerable position, and Mexico may seek to annex the new state itself."
 GUA_LEADER_DESC_BARRUNDIA:0 "Juan Martín Barrundia has many problems, and, unlike his predecessor Calixto Mendizabal, he is not ready to take on them or handle them with the urgency and personality they demand.\n\nAlthough general Barrundia has always been a liberal he had no problems becoming president Mendizabal's second in command as both were personal friends from their time in the army. Having fought together against rebels and bandits, once Calixto was appointed President he was requested to partake as Minister of War, and later, as his right hand in most affairs. Him, as president Mendizabal, was a Guatemalan nationalist and despite having liberal ideas he would only use them to improve the regions he deemed fit. It is because of this that he quickly alienated the other representatives of the senate, who came from marginalized provinces.\n\nDuring his period as Minister of War he ordered the construction of many forts along the Yucatanese border, fearing an impending invasion by the Spanish in an attempt to take over the weakened state of Centroamerica. These buildings would eventually prove prophetic. Once Centroamerica Collapsed following Calixto's assassination he realised that running a country was harder than it seemed and because of his inability to find a common policy after the Nicaraguan revolt, most of the provinces followed the trend by declaring their independence.\n\nNow Juan Martín Barrundia is alone in the crosshairs as everyone in Guatemala blames him for the disintegration of the Centroamerican State."
 COS_LEADER_DESC_ALFARO:0 "Bernardo S. Alfaro was born the 12th of February of 1854 to the Soto and Alfaro families, two of the most powerful houses of the entirety of Costa Rica, who became rich by trading coffee in the new world for several centuries. Following the Costa Rican entry into the Centroamerican state the familiar enterprise decayed due to the instability that plagued the nation and the challenging prices set up by the Spanish in Cuba and Puerto Rico.\n\nNot much after his eight birthday he was enrolled in a military school to follow the steps of his father Apolinar Soto, a renowned militar, but he was fit for far more greatness. After finishing his studies with the rank of Brigadier Bernardo joined the Liberal party despite being part of a majoritarily Conservative caste. This caused distress at home and Bernardo was disinherited from the family fortune and banished from their domains.\n\nDespite all of this setbacks, he managed to gain a position in the Centroamerican council along many other Liberals, which formed the opposition against Calixto and his Conservatives. \n\nHe was recalled to Costa Rica after Calixto's assassination and following the formation of the new local government he was appointed as Military Head of State by the weak local senate in an attempt to unite the new country's rebellious military and the inefficient politicians, which surprisingly good results. Now, leading a loyal country, he must stand against all the enemies that will dare attempt contest his rule."
 DAG_LEADER_DESC_JAMMALUDIN:0 "Born in the harsh mountains of the Caucasus, Jammaludin has had a long and hard life. His father died during a tribal raid by the Chechens when Jammaladin was only 13, leaving him and his mother to fend for themselves. Jammaludin would do this and more, however, scraping together enough money to pay the local imam to study religion for a few years. \n\nAfter finishing his brief education, Jammaludin began travelling the mountains of Dagestan, leading prayer among the small and isolated communities there. This changed when the Avar Khanate collapsed for good, after nearly a century of teetering on the edge of destruction. With no unified government over the Caucasus, the various ethnic groups with feuds extending back centuries exploded into conflict with one another.\n\nJammaludin, already well-known in Dagestan for his religious work, began calling for unity among the Muslim Turkic people there, to present a united front against foreign invaders to the highlands. This message of unity was well-received, and with a great deal of convincing Jammaludin Imam bound together a loose confederation of tribes, the Dagestani Imamate. \n\nAt first, Jammaludin, more concerned with religious unity than ethnic, sought to expand the Imamate to the other ethnic groups of Dagestan peacefully. However this strategy met limited success, with only some scattered villages in need of some form of protection. No strong pacifist, Jammaludin began conquering the Avar tribes that refused to submit to the confederation’s authority.\n\nNow with a united Dagestan, Jammaludin Imam has focused on protecting his country from any foreign heathens that might seek to impose their authority upon the mountains, be it from the South, North, or West."

 KLE_LEADER_DESC_WILHELM_II:0 "Although not the youngest monarch of german states, he is however one of the most experienced.\n\nBorn in the early 19th century somewhere around 14th of May 1814 and currently a Duke in his early seventies, Wilhelm is one of the last representatives of the “Old German school of rulers”. During his youth Wilhelm loved spending time reading old english novels and was rather passionate about learning german history and acquiring skills necessary to become a proper noble. Most of servants stated that Duke Friedrich Wilhelm's successor was praiseworthy. People of Kleve love their Duke and are showing that in their daily prayers for a long and healthy life of Wilhelm. During his long reign Wilhelm has seen many changes, revolutions and other disastrous things happen in the Holy Roman Empire, but nonetheless, he has stood strong in his authoritarian but benevolent ways. Now he awaits, finding all those changes thriving."
 ALB_LEADER_DESC_GJERJG:0 "Gjergj III is a young, popular monarch among the Albanians. He is widely revered across his country for his kindness, generosity, and fair treatment of all Albanians, regardless of strata. Son of Gjergj II and an Austrian princess, he hopes to use his Austrian ties to secure a military alliance between the two nations.\n\nHe is a monarch of many ambitions, hoping to liberate all Albanians under foreign rule. He especially despises the Venetians, and has plans to seize Albania’s coast from their hands and bring Albania out from the isolation of the mountains.\n\nHe knows he must temper his ambitions with diplomatic caution, or else he may antagonize the much stronger powers in the area. He must also be sure to manage his dynasty properly, lest he become a puppet of the Austrian Empire. Gjergj has a lot of cards in his hands, but if he can play them off correctly, he could turn Albania from a small, isolated mountain kingdom to a dominant power in the Balkans and possibly beyond."
 MIL_LEADER_DESC_RUDOLF:0 "Titles: Holy Roman Emperor; King of Jerusalem (titular): King of Bohemia; King of Croatia; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Milan and others\n\nIn 1884 Rudolf was crowned Duke of Milan alongside his many other titles. An ordinary Habsburg may have overlooked the duchy, as so many had done before, but Rudolf was no ordinary Habsburg. Instead he focused on Milan. Since becoming a Habsburg possession in 1526, Milan had been squeezed for every florin it was worth by high taxes to fund Austria’s conquests. Beyond the minimum necessary to secure each new Milanese cheque, the Habsburgs couldn’t have cared less for the comings and goings of Milan. Slowly the Milanese government became corrupt, inept, and slothly. Milanese nationalistis looked to the deposed House of Sforza for governance, whilst others looked to Florentine and Venetian republics as model for the new Milan. None of these ventures panned out, and the iron grip of the Habsburgs continued to squeeze tighter and tighter: until Rudolf. Rudolf’s agenda is twofold; the unification of all Germans, and the creation of a modern state in which to house them. Even Germans who had forgotten their heritage, such as the Longobards.\n\nA great challenge faced Rudolf in Milan. The people of the duchy yearned for change, yet his predecessors' rule had left the nation in a sorry state. It was in this that Rudolf was granted an opportunity. If his theories on modernization could work in Milan, they could work anywhere, and with the support of the people the task of implementing his reforms should be simple. However the young prince was naive. Rudolf may have been a rose among thorns, but he was a Habsburg rose. Many in the duchy distrusted him, radical republicans and corrupt officials alike opposed his reforms. But Rudolf was the most powerful man in Europe, why should some upstart Italians stop him? And if the rest of the Habsburgs cared little for Milan, why should they care what he did there? After two failed coups, first by republicans then by corrupt officials who clung to power like a sailor to a plank, Rudolf’s power in Milan was finally consolidated. Now he can begin to take the first tentative steps to implementing his twin agendas of modernization and germanization. Now the year is 1886, and the question for both the Milanese and Rudolf is simple; what comes next?"

However, his father was not the most present person for him, too busy for his son, he left it to the officers and nannies to prepare his son.\n\nFinally that day arrived, it is time for Francisco to do what he has been prepared for so long, however our new Roy Francisco is not the one the officers and his late father had hoped for, Francisco is mocked for his authoritarianism, certainly pushed but inferior to that of his father who must have been an example to be surpassed.Now no one knows what the future holds for King Francisco."
