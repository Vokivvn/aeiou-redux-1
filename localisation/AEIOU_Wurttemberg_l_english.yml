  wur_idea_strong_clergy:0 "Strong Clergy"
  wur_idea_strong_clergy_desc:0 "The clergy in Wurttemberg represents a powerful force that has heavy influence over the ducal court politics. Though most of the ecclesiastical powers within the duchy are nominally independent of the duke, they have latched themselves onto Karl and I have benefited from it heavily. Early in his reign, the Duke looked for allies to take on the merchant class and solidify his power. By aiding the duke in consolidating his power they were able to grow their own influence, establishing a codependent relationship with the temporal power of the realm.\n\nWithin the court, they wield much influence, even the duke isn't free of it. The Abbot of Zwiefalten represents the clergy in the court, having the ear of Karl in many decisions. The amount of power has brought some opposition from the struggling middle class and a small number of nobles left in the duchy. Both see the ever-increasing power of the clergy as a threat to theirs and petition the duke for stripping their privileges."

  wur_idea_merchants_ravensburg:0 "Merchants of Ravensburg"
  wur_idea_merchants_ravensburg_desc:0 "Though the duke has done his best to repress them, the merchant class in the city of Ravensburg remains a powerful force in Wurttemberg and the main opposition against Karl. The city used to be a Free City within the Empire, though their annexation was allowed to the duchy after they chose the wrong side in one of the many wars of the princes. Their time free allowed a very strong merchant class to develop, using the importance of trade in the city to grow their wealth and power. A council of nobles would soon become the ruling class in the city.\n\nDuke Karl would make it his mission to seize the power and wealth of these merchants, employing the clergy as his close allies. His measures to drive them out of the city and business were only partially successful. Though weaker than they were before the merchants still hold most of the market share on trade within the duchy. This poses a threat to the duke who needs their funds to continue his ambitious expansion."

  wur_idea_concentrated_power:0 "Concentrated Power"
  wur_idea_concentrated_power_desc:0 "By allying with the clergy and antagonizing the minor nobles and merchants of his land, Karl has been able to gather almost all the power of the domain into his own hands. A number of taxes and quotations have stifled the growth of the merchant class, the duke has started to win the battle in trade against them. With their destruction he will have a near-monopoly on trade within his realm, giving him a much deeper pool of funds.\n\nIt was Karl's ancestors that started the war of power against the minor nobles. Using tactics like marriage and falsified documents, the Wurttemberg family has seized a number of castles and tracts of land. Through all of these actions, not counting the powerful clergy, Karl is almost the sole power in his duchy. This has allowed him to act with almost complete impunity, taxes and men levied at will. While he still does face some opposition in the groups that he has weakened, he now moves to take their influence out completely."
